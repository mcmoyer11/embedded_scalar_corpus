41:21	You know , is there something else 0 we could have done *T*-1 , you know , in *-2 checking out all the places that , uh , *T*-3 might be available . E_S
53:49	and , um , she had used the walker \[ for , \+ for \] quite some time , probably about six to nine months . E_S
96:19	I mean , for somebody who *T*-1 \[ is , \+ \] you know , for most of their life \[ has , \+ has , \] uh , not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm , ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines . E_S
157:111	I mean , \[ \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I har- , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] truly wish that if something like that were *-1 to happen that my children would do something like , that for me . E_S
157:148	I mean , \[ \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I har- , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] truly wish that if something like that were *-1 to happen that my children would do something like , that for me . E_S
225:163	I mean , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I di- , \] \+ I \] do n't know \[ how I would , \+ how I would \] deal *T*-1 if one of my parents came \[ with , \+ with \] Alzheimer 's . or something like , that \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is \] far more devastating . E_S
291:187	But , I guess 0 as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation \[ \[ \[ \[ we , \+ we do n't , \] \+ we , \] \+ we , \] \+ we \] choose *-1 not to deal with the , extended family because we feel 0 it 's kind of cumbersome , when in reality it makes things much much easier *T*-2 . E_S
363:46	That 's just a matter of * defining priorities , I guess or some priorities anyway . E_S
456:26	Um , but still , it gives it some variety .
489:7	And sometimes I wear a blazer with them , E_S
662:45	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] noticed yesterday in the paper , something 0 *T*-1 said that it , N_S
668:79	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] tend *-1 to , I think 0 *T*-3 , overreact occasionally when somebody tells me 0 it 's that great *T*-2 . E_S
710:84	Um , the other one , SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , is kind of \[ a , \+ a \] gory movie , \[ if , \+ if \] somebody 's not into that kind of stuff . E_S
732:36	Anyway , it 's on from seven to nine , or something . E_S
761:22	I think 0 it was something that he really wanted *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S
801:56	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said *T*-1 ,
862:26	um , if \[ privacy is something that *T*-2 disturbs your private state , \+ I mean an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-3 disturbs your private state , \] E_S that 's one thing , E_S
862:76	um , if \[ privacy is something that *T*-2 disturbs your private state , \+ I mean an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-3 disturbs your private state , \] E_S that 's one thing , E_S
863:18	and if privacy is something that *T*-1 comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something *ICH*-2 out about you that 's another . E_S
863:74	and if privacy is something that *T*-1 comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something *ICH*-2 out about you that 's another . E_S
865:39	but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that *T*-1 should be private *T*-2 , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday . E_S
868:124	I think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *T*-1 happens , uh , when the phone rang *T*-2 E_S and it 's T I 0 *T*-3 calling , E_S my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message E_S
869:36	and then I realize , oh , no , this is something 0 I solicited *T*-1 , E_S
905:42	and \[ you , \+ one 's \] feeling obligated , because of some sense \[ of , \+ of \] the way 0 the ritual is played *-1 out *T*-2 . E_S
947:56	Uh , if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something 0 you do n't know *T*-1 about it , well , then I guess 0 one could assume 0 one was invaded *-2 E_S
962:11	and if someone finds out something about me that *T*-1 is true , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have a sense of loss from that . E_S
962:21	and if someone finds out something about me that *T*-1 is true , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have a sense of loss from that . E_S
967:68	Um , \[ the , \+ the \] other side of that might be 0 \[ if , \+ if \] someone found out something *RNR*-1 or surmised something *RNR*-1 that *T*-2 were n't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense . E_S
967:79	Um , \[ the , \+ the \] other side of that might be 0 \[ if , \+ if \] someone found out something *RNR*-1 or surmised something *RNR*-1 that *T*-2 were n't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense . E_S
967:91	Um , \[ the , \+ the \] other side of that might be 0 \[ if , \+ if \] someone found out something *RNR*-1 or surmised something *RNR*-1 that *T*-2 were n't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense . E_S
971:27	\[ ev- , \+ \] more harmed or something . E_S
991:41	And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information \[ from a , \+ \] that I would rather 0 they did n't *T*-1 E_S
997:101	\[ so , \+ or \] if my call rate \[ of , \+ of \] eight \[ t- , \+ \] or so a week went up even higher because , uh , someone \[ had , \+ had , \] N_S
1028:40	and they would n't bother *-1 to check that carefully anyway to someone who *T*-2 's offering , you know , full cash price , for it . E_S
1033:14	and there 's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone , any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *T*-2 , what your spending habits are *T*-3 , E_S
1051:64	If I deviate from social norms of behavior , if I run up and down the street *-1 yelling or something , someone 's going *-2 to invade my privacy very quickly . E_S
1051:69	If I deviate from social norms of behavior , if I run up and down the street *-1 yelling or something , someone 's going *-2 to invade my privacy very quickly . E_S
1103:63	and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized 0 that 's actually something that *T*-1 's culturally relative . E_S
1107:72	\[ and , \+ and \] that it *EXP*-2 's fascinating * \[ to , \+ to \] think a lot of someone who *T*-1 does n't know how *-3 to say private *T*-4 . E_S
1125:24	Because anyone can be alone for some period of time E_S
1136:68	All \[ the class- , \+ the other classic \] examples , the Jehovah 's Witness \[ or , \+ or \] Mormons or someone knocking at the front door , um , which *T*-1 is more intrusive because I have *-2 to really tell someone *-3 to go away . E_S

1139:35	\[ and nor- , \+ and they 're \] doing something that normally I really only invite , people to *T*-1 . E_S
1149:60	Have you ever gotten one of those calls that *T*-1 is either generated *-2 by a computer or somebody going down a list E_S
1151:16	or they 're introducing some new product in the area E_S
1153:32	or you 're in the middle of * cooking something E_S
1172:14	or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read *T*-1 probably a thousand times that day already . E_S
1179:18	I 've even had some of them , E_S
1186:5	sometimes \[ I , \+ I \] get them on my , uh , answering machine at home E_S
1208:11	and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand *T*-1 . E_S
1216:20	I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door , either religious groups , or people peddling products . E_S
1227:26	and they 're trying *-1 to sell something E_S
1231:12	I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago E_S
1235:31	\[ and \+ uh , and \] it was somebody from , um , oh what was it *T*-1 , the , uh , Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , E_S
1278:32	but I 'm sure 0 I could rig up something . E_S
1284:25	I wonder if there would be some way 0 we could get these people to do this get their names , their addresses , and their phone numbers E_S and then reverse it , E_S and do *T*-1 , N_S
1306:41	but I remember 0 \[ you , \+ you \] talked about something , E_S
1310:12	You said something else . E_S
1609:51	I do n't know how many times I 've done that *T*-1 *-2 to do something , post office or the bank or any kind of errand , E_S
1639:25	I think 0 there is still some discrimination there where \[ as , \+ \] you know , men and women work in the same job *T*-1 , E_S
1686:33	and , uh , quite honestly , I , I have some little children E_S
1828:40	\[ it may have , \+ it may have \] been somebody else , because \[ I think , \+ I think \] that even Jimi Hendrix did it , E_S
1830:88	you know , * come *-1 to think of it , I think 0 that was a cover version of , like a John Lee Hooker song , or something , E_S
1842:23	I mean I 've heard some songs \[ that , \+ that \] I just thought 0 *T*-1 were horrendous cover versions of , N_S
1939:11	I saw some promise , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] a lot of the new wave , \[ when it , \+ when it \] came out , uh , back in the mid and early eighties *T*-1 . E_S
1986:26	Because , I mean , there are some
1988:13	there are some , you know , types of heavy metal that I really like *T*-1 , E_S
2006:6	some of it , N_S
2016:52	But , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] trying *-1 to make it somewhat more modern . E_S
2091:52	and then we write down \[ each , \+ each \] time 0 we spend something *T*-1 , we write down in a book E_S
2099:21	Um , \[ it takes some , \+ it *EXP*-1 takes some \] dedication * to do it , E_S
2099:39	Um , \[ it takes some , \+ it *EXP*-1 takes some \] dedication * to do it , E_S
2114:34	\[ if you ca n't stay , \+ if something comes up and you ca n't stay \] within it then we have , uh , you know , a budget for , you know , like 0 we call *T*-1 our slush fund or something E_S

2117:38	You do n't have *-1 to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that . E_S
2179:40	so \[ we have , \+ both of us have \] some money in an I R A that we 're also trying *-1 to figure *T*-2 , N_S
2198:136	and they did an analysis *ICH*-4 for us based on what we were putting *T*-1 in and the time frame that we wanted *-2 to look at *T*-3 , and then gave us \[ a good idea back , \+ you know , some good information *ICH*-6 back \] on whether or not we were going *-5 to achieve those goals , \[ and , \+ or \] not , and what we needed *-7 to do *T*-8 so that we could achieve them and the money 0 we could put *T*-9 in at what time . E_S
2212:106	and he 's \[ set up , \+ uh , you know , determined \] how much \[ we need *-1 to , \+ you know , we need *T*-3 if \] something were *-2 to happen . E_S
2215:160	\[ that , \+ that 's \] the other financial thing 0 I guess that we 've done *T*-1 is with our life insurance is , since I 'm at home now \[ is , \+ is \] * figuring out , uh , what we would need *T*-2 if something happened to my husband , or what he would need *T*-3 if something happened to me , E_S
2215:199	\[ that , \+ that 's \] the other financial thing 0 I guess that we 've done *T*-1 is with our life insurance is , since I 'm at home now \[ is , \+ is \] * figuring out , uh , what we would need *T*-2 if something happened to my husband , or what he would need *T*-3 if something happened to me , E_S
2221:26	if , \[ he , \+ \] something would happen to him , I would n't stay in Texas , E_S
2272:108	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * kind of strange because \[ I , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] not unusual * to , uh , see , uh , an engineering manual or something laying around the house E_S
2316:66	Uh , one of its great slogans is 0 if you 're not serving the customer , you better be serving someone who *T*-1 is *?* . E_S
2333:28	well , uh , maybe I am into some things *ICH*-1 occasionally that I do n't think of *T*-2 in terms of self improvement . E_S
2343:22	I , uh , have attended some seminars that *T*-1 had some tapes that *T*-2 went with them , but , uh , I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , E_S
2343:40	I , uh , have attended some seminars that *T*-1 had some tapes that *T*-2 went with them , but , uh , I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , E_S
2343:99	I , uh , have attended some seminars that *T*-1 had some tapes that *T*-2 went with them , but , uh , I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , E_S
2371:69	\[ and , \+ uh , but \] as you say \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \+ sometimes it *EXP*-1 's \] difficult * \[ to , \+ to \] know if it 's , you know , N_S
2372:19	I think 0 if somebody would say hey , * read these ten books because these are self-improvements , I would probably be turned *-1 off to them . E_S
2398:28	you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other E_S
2399:24	but , uh , I think 0 sometimes the word is a little over used E_S
2451:47	and where we are *T*-1 now , what we 're doing *T*-2 is some very big lawsuits that *T*-3 happen *-4 to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents . E_S
2579:18	Well I 've seen some people try *-2 to just come in like over the weekend because they want *-1 to use the TexTeller machine . E_S
2691:5	sometimes I worry about , you know , if I go in in pants , E_S
2696:7	And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that \[ would , \+ will \] hold you back , you know , if you do n't dress in , you know , your * dress for success business suits everyday \[ if , \+ you know , if \] upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on , E_S
2715:7	and sometimes he wears the jacket to it . E_S
2719:8	And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes E_S
2725:44	With \[ the , \+ you know , the \] little suspenders or something on E_S
2764:15	I 've done some of the other speech programs , E_S
2860:93	and if you look outside , you would like *-1 to go out and mow your lawn , if you could go out and buy a new spark plug , or something along those lines , E_S
2966:39	Well , I thought 0 I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere . E_S
3025:20	I 've known Jack for some time . E_S
3045:41	\[ I , \+ I \] was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though *T*-1 . E_S
3049:30	I 'm sure 0 you have a representative somewhere in the area . If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative , E_S
3150:71	and \[ if , \+ if \] anything *ICH*-1 ever happened , God forbid , you know , a building explosion or something \[ tha- , \+ \] we 'd be able *-2 to track chemicals from that building with our weather station . E_S
3204:49	\[ So , \+ so \] then \[ we got , \+ we got \] some same things E_S because , N_S
3221:19	like , * give me some examples . E_S
3292:35	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] what some people call like *T*-1 really heavy metal . E_S
3367:17	They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that . E_S
3625:5	somebody tried *-1 to call me last night E_S
3667:77	and , uh , you know , whenever \[ \[ we , \+ he , \] \+ my \] husband has time off or something *T*-1 , we take them to the zoo , E_S
3692:235	\[ we have , \+ we try \] *-2 to spend like Monday nights , we call it family home evening , and , \[ have our kids , \+ uh , you know , have little lessons with them , \] and , you know , just \[ \[ see , \+ count , \] \+ see \] how things are going *T*-3 in our family and , you know , teach them about their grandparents or something like that . Bring out pictures of them so they get *-4 to know them E_S
3739:133	You know the kids just think 0 it *EXP*-1 's wonderful just maybe * to go *-2 get an ice cream cone or , yeah , or , uh , you know , go *-2 get a bag of M and M 's or something like that , E_S
3746:100	\[ our , \+ our \] whole weekends \[ are divi- , \+ are devoted *-1 \] to our children except for we might go out , you know , one evening or something , E_S
3792:44	and , uh , \[ there 's , \+ uh , there 's \] some petting , you know , like , uh , uh , N_S
3872:17	Well I 've gotten some good ideas from you . E_S
4002:22	he did , well , in some of the later movies
4026:105	Well , you know \[ he was , \+ when was it *T*-1 , last year or year before last , he was \] voted *-2 the sexiest actor in movies , or something . E_S
4120:22	I think 0 that 's something 0 we all ca- , N_S
4293:22	and perhaps , it 's because somehow that implies to me 0 it 's not fun , or something like that . E_S
4293:58	and perhaps , it 's because somehow that implies to me 0 it 's not fun , or something like that . E_S
4299:26	She feels like if it 's something that you have *-1 to do *T*-2 , you know , if you look at it as if you have *-3 to do it , then \[ it becomes , \+ it becomes \] a chore , E_S
4311:129	So , um , and I feel that way too as far as , you know , * just sitting and \[ doing , \+ you know , \[ to , \+ \] the idea of * doing \] fifty sit-ups or something , you know , E_S
4331:64	Is that why you like aerobics classes *T*-1 , because \[ you 're not , sort of , \+ \] someone else is doing the counting for you , so , it makes it less of a chore ? E_S
4358:9	\[ someone , \+ like you said , someone \] else is counting ,
4358:30	\[ someone , \+ like you said , someone \] else is counting ,
4366:10	And , someone else is telling me , okay , you know , * let 's move this way , let 's move that way , instead of me having *-1 to think about it so much . E_S
4373:19	You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise E_S
4391:48	and \[ \[ it 's , \+ it , \] \+ it 's \] something 0 you can all , N_S
4409:23	Well , you 're talking to someone from California where it 's often swimming weather *T*-1 . E_S
4435:85	Um , in California there 's , uh , almost an assumption , um , unless you 're , sort of , clearly of an older generation *ICH*-1 , or something , you know , in your sixties , or something like that , E_S
4435:113	Um , in California there 's , uh , almost an assumption , um , unless you 're , sort of , clearly of an older generation *ICH*-1 , or something , you know , in your sixties , or something like that , E_S
4439:34	Uh , E_S there 's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ \] at least in urban California . E_S
4453:18	So , there must be something to some of them . E_S
4453:25	So , there must be something to some of them . E_S
4477:167	And , uh , oh \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] \[ uni- , \+ University \] of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER . Which *T*-1 \[ is , \+ \] uh , turned into a fairly well subscribed to , uh , newsletter , monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that E_S
4485:45	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] it 's had that orientation for quite some time . E_S
4486:20	Um , there 's been some progressive medical schools *EXP*-1 out here , that *T*-2 have taken that approach . E_S
4514:61	from institutes of learning like that , I know that they 've got *-1 to get their money somewhere , E_S

4774:9	If someone is known *-1 to have been in prison , they ca n't get a job . E_S

5426:15	It 's just something 0 I have never developed , uh , an interest in *T*-1 . E_S

6585:161	But it *EXP*-1 might be interesting * to see what *T*-2 would happen if you took kids \[ at a , \+ \] and then took then to another country instead of * having being exposed *-5 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here , and take them to some other country that *T*-3 had different moral values , like Saudi Arabia where they could n't drink *T*-4 . E_S
6601:31	because from what I understand *T*-1 , from some of the guys 0 I know *T*-2 , you know , crime , uh , is punishable , just almost , uh , instantly and public , E_S
6613:74	I 've heard that like in China and stuff , there is virtually no such thing as rape , because if you rape somebody you 'd be murdered *-1 , you know , on the , you know , street E_S
6619:201	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess , 0 in my own , * having had the whole three or four minutes 0 * to , you know , give it a great deal of thought *T*-1 , you know , Um , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary , E_S
6635:102	People that *T*-1 might benefit most from it *ICH*-4 might not go in that situation , you know , like people that *T*-2 really are trapped *-3 in a ghetto or something like that . E_S
6680:29	It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *T*-1 here and develop some pride in them , if it was handled *-2 that way . E_S
6680:62	It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have *T*-1 here and develop some pride in them , if it was handled *-2 that way . E_S
6707:54	and the only opposition to it really was that it was , you know , starting some sort of a military elitist type , you know , special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing . E_S
6714:25	really there could be , um , some scandals involved * , if , you know , it was n't people that *T*-1 were really fair and \[ le- , \+ you know , in a legal \] way or something , E_S
6714:124	really there could be , um , some scandals involved * , if , you know , it was n't people that *T*-1 were really fair and \[ le- , \+ you know , in a legal \] way or something , E_S
6718:76	they could send all the people over to , uh , you know , one particular part of town or one particular project , that somebody had paid somebody * to , you know , get supported *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
6718:85	they could send all the people over to , uh , you know , one particular part of town or one particular project , that somebody had paid somebody * to , you know , get supported *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
6741:33	and know matter where you build it *T*-1 , somebody else is going *-2 to scream , well , you did n't build one over here . E_S
6745:10	Unfair or something , E_S
6773:12	She started some type of , um , national organization for youth to volunteer *-2 to \[ teach , \+ tutor \] other kids to read and , you know , do different service projects like that and trying * to get youth more directed towards , you know , helpful things , E_S
6809:100	and they have situations \[ like , \+ like \] that down there . Where \[ they , \+ they \] have , \[ these , \+ the \] social , in some sort of way *T*-1 , N_S
6827:40	but , uh , unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that , Red Cross , it was so many of them in it , that \[ at any particular chance , \+ your chance \] of * having *-1 to do something \[ was , \+ it was \] very slim . E_S
6827:136	but , uh , unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that , Red Cross , it was so many of them in it , that \[ at any particular chance , \+ your chance \] of * having *-1 to do something \[ was , \+ it was \] very slim . E_S
6865:18	He had a direct connection somewhere , uh , E_S
6883:21	and the church helps them out some , E_S
6914:48	but \[ \[ I , \+ I \] just , \+ you know , sometimes I just \] do n't like everybody knowing everything about me , you know , E_S
7012:36	Well \[ the , \+ the \] other thing 0 some people are not aware of *T*-1 , is 0 they will use \[ their A , \+ their \] credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash E_S
7087:14	And , then , some people they get so wrapped up in them that \[ they find , \+ you know , one day they find , \] wow , I did n't realize 0 \[ I had this much , \+ you know , I 'd spent this much \] money . E_S
7096:12	Well , and some people use one credit card *-1 to pay for another credit card 0 they own *T*-2 , E_S
7117:47	It *EXP*-1 's enjoyable * \[ talking with , \+ seeing \] that somebody feels the same way , E_S
7146:18	And I play the organ sometimes , uh , just for my own satisfaction . Not for anybody else 's ears E_S
7179:91	\[ if I could have , \+ if I could make \] it on the road , I 'd like *-1 to play on like a bluegrass band or something , E_S
7260:11	we did some remodeling when we bought a house *T*-1 , E_S
7262:13	and painting and some wallpapering , E_S
7277:19	* kind of gives you some space for yourself , E_S
7278:62	and that 's what I find *T*-2 in * making the dolls and things , that it gives me something that I can create *T*-1 , E_S
7280:12	I made some afghans and that kind of stuff . E_S
7356:11	they have some nice stuff down there . E_S
7502:69	I think 0 in , uh , the Texas governor elections , I think more people turned out *-1 to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . E_S
7502:78	I think 0 in , uh , the Texas governor elections , I think more people turned out *-1 to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . E_S
7520:64	the elections where they have that topic *T*-2 seem *-1 to be a little bit better *ICH*-3 attended than some of the other ones . E_S
7531:35	I can understand \[ why , \+ why \] some of \[ the , \+ the \] rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for \[ the , \+ the \] Midwest *T*-1 , E_S
7531:95	I can understand \[ why , \+ why \] some of \[ the , \+ the \] rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for \[ the , \+ the \] Midwest *T*-1 , E_S
7580:15	MUMBLEx * hope some of the local , N_S
7752:16	But , there are some others out there that I do n't believe 0 *T*-1 deserve the money 0 they 're getting *T*-2 . E_S
7771:41	the teams that *T*-1 were there last year were , see , somebody from California , E_S
7837:5	sometimes \[ when I , \+ if you \] go out there during the day , you just fry under the sun . E_S
7858:68	and it 's going *-1 to have little shopping centers in it and \[ little \+ \] like a lake or something running through it . E_S
7951:28	but it 's like , they 'll try something E_S
7952:31	and then they throw it out , and get something else , you know , E_S
7967:5	sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad . E_S
7976:45	but \[ the politics , \+ the politics \] gets worse in the small towns sometimes . E_S
7983:15	I mean , somebody walks in \[ the , \+ a \] classroom E_S
8006:32	and they 'll tell you 0 they 've written something down , E_S
8345:20	If you ca n't afford something good , you know , E_S
8441:78	so \[ at \+ \] least we know 0 \[ we 're , \+ it 's \] not going *-1 to fall in or something if it 's built *-2 . E_S
8525:99	But the thing , uh , also is that , you know , like if you want *-1 to go out like if you want *-2 to go to a restaurant or something , then I have *-3 to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go *-4 eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars , um , you know , three times a week . E_S
8626:54	so I wo n't have *-1 to , you know , rush a letter to him or something , E_S
8649:25	You want *-1 to get into some kind of manufacturing , E_S
8680:13	so she brings some money in . E_S
8709:42	we 've got \[ a , \+ several \] credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of *-1 paying *T*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time . E_S
8709:103	we 've got \[ a , \+ several \] credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of *-1 paying *T*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time . E_S
8722:67	because the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like if I want something \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] ask somebody , you know , E_S
8722:98	because the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like if I want something \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] ask somebody , you know , E_S
8735:12	that 's something that you can use *T*-1 . E_S
8761:7	and some you do n't care about *T*-1 , you know , E_S
8858:48	But one of the things that I do *T*-1 when I 've got some spare time *T*-2 is I do some woodworking . E_S
8858:68	But one of the things that I do *T*-1 when I 've got some spare time *T*-2 is I do some woodworking . E_S
8859:66	And that , oh , I guess , ranges anywhere from , uh , carpentry work to , um , um , some types of furniture and , um , oh , I do n't know what you would call them *T*-1 , knickknacks , I guess , stuff 0 you hang *T*-2 on the wall *-3 to put a mirror on *T*-2 E_S
8860:14	and I made some , um , candle sconces that you hang *T*-1 on the ... N_S
8865:12	There 's something about * working with wood \[ that , \+ that \] I enjoy *T*-1 , that , N_S
8877:24	so I guess 0 I get some of both . E_S
8878:16	What *T*-1 are some of your things 0 you like *-2 to do *T*-3 ? E_S
8917:48	She enjoys *-1 doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something 0 * to cover \[ her , \+ her \] legs and feet with *T*-2 while she is working on it . E_S
8923:20	So , those things they take some time 0 * to make *T*-1 . E_S
8950:32	first thing that *T*-1 comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece \[ of , \+ of \] afghan . E_S
8960:41	If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected *-1 some time or other , * do n't worry about it . E_S
8981:33	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , sometimes they get disconnected *-1 when I 'm talking to them *T*-2 . E_S
9098:86	\[ Do you , \+ uh , do you \] think that those are bigger contributors than things like \[ ai- , \+ acid \] rain and some of the pollutants that *T*-1 come from , uh , industrial areas , factories and so on ? E_S
9128:21	People say that it is somewhat better . E_S
9188:50	but I do think that , um , Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards . E_S
9208:121	I guess 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] to the point where I 'm cynical enough that I really do n't believe 0 anything will happen \[ unless , \+ unless \] there 's something economically justifiable about it *T*-1 . E_S
9212:45	And in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , *-1 to be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it . E_S
9271:30	Uh , once in a while we 'll get some , uh , E_S
9445:74	well , I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild *T*-1 , you know , places like Monterey , California or , you know , N_S
9469:5	some people say , uh , 0 \[ they , \+ they \] like *-1 to watch the changing of the seasons E_S
9478:51	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 \[ \[ in , \+ in some , \] \+ in some \] respects it probably MUMBLEx more tolerable . E_S
9478:65	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 \[ \[ in , \+ in some , \] \+ in some \] respects it probably MUMBLEx more tolerable . E_S
9481:77	well I guess 0 \[ this , \+ the \] weather is n't as lively a topic \[ as , \+ uh , as \] some of the others 0 we might have gotten *T*-1 . E_S
9489:40	I guess 0 we 're supposed *-1 to say good-bye or something , and think about what N_S
9493:26	Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics E_S
9493:44	Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics E_S
9535:20	And then I 've seen some of the STAR TREK movies . E_S
9546:74	\[ When I , \+ when I \] started *-1 thinking about this *T*-2 , \[ that \+ \] those are some of my favorite shows ,
9570:22	He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder . E_S
9590:65	But , unfortunately I find 0 * getting rid *-1 of your T V set , you do throw out \[ some , \+ some \] of the baby , with the bath water . E_S
9590:74	But , unfortunately I find 0 * getting rid *-1 of your T V set , you do throw out \[ some , \+ some \] of the baby , with the bath water . E_S
9696:17	and they 're watching something worthwhile , while I can make dinner and do things 0 I need *-1 to do *T*-2 without them under foot . E_S
9716:19	I think 0 \[ some shows , \+ some , \] N_S
9716:29	I think 0 \[ some shows , \+ some , \] N_S
9724:26	even in for kids * watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff . E_S
9724:50	even in for kids * watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff . E_S
9759:34	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] seen some of them on repeats . E_S
9791:15	They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan , E_S
9829:94	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] ended up *-1 watching a lot of these things on , you know , repeats in the afternoons or something . E_S
9926:114	and , uh , \[ they 've been , \+ they 've been \] \[ under , \+ under \] the oppression that they 've been under *T*-1 for so long that now 0 they have some freedoms E_S
9928:60	They do n't understand that * to make that work , E_S they 've got *-1 to take some responsibility for themselves . E_S
9931:55	when they give you the freedom * to take care of yourself *T*-1 then that puts some responsibility on you as well . E_S
9955:98	and it 's really \[ kind of , \+ kind of \] late * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] start , be trying *-2 to trade for somebody , especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have *T*-1 . E_S
10030:12	He 's something else , E_S
10082:48	I like *-1 to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times *T*-2 . E_S
10107:19	Would n't it *EXP*-1 be something * to have a World Series between \[ Da- , \+ \] the Rangers and the Astros . E_S
10123:15	would n't that be something . E_S
10129:12	That 's something 0 you dream about *T*-1 . E_S
10171:15	they were saying something about 0 this may be his last year with the Rangers though . E_S
10195:40	unfortunately the Rangers do n't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do *?* . E_S
10433:22	They usually are *?* after something like that happens to them . E_S
10434:27	It seems *-1 to mellow them or something . E_S
10453:46	and I feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time 0 *-1 to play with them and things *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
10687:24	I mean , oh , if something happens to her . E_S
10799:51	but , uh , uh , \[ it , \+ it \] did show \[ \[ some , \+ some , \] \+ uh , some \] interesting things about the F B I E_S
10799:59	but , uh , uh , \[ it , \+ it \] did show \[ \[ some , \+ some , \] \+ uh , some \] interesting things about the F B I E_S
10799:76	but , uh , uh , \[ it , \+ it \] did show \[ \[ some , \+ some , \] \+ uh , some \] interesting things about the F B I E_S
10853:46	Well \[ as , it , \+ as I recall it \] got some Academy Awards , did n't it . E_S
10968:88	\[ but , \+ uh , but \] we have gone through \[ these , \+ these \] lapses \[ of , \+ of \] a relationship , \[ somewhat , \+ sometimes , \] E_S
10968:96	\[ but , \+ uh , but \] we have gone through \[ these , \+ these \] lapses \[ of , \+ of \] a relationship , \[ somewhat , \+ sometimes , \] E_S
11040:16	but they 're predicting some more snow for our direction . E_S
11135:18	it 's just that sometimes it 's not the right people , which *T*-1 is \[ really , \+ really \] sad because , I wish 0 we would do more . E_S
11146:17	but , you know sometimes it dwindles down . E_S
11156:19	at least you 're trying something . E_S
11176:19	but it does defray it some . E_S
11190:55	you know that was one thing 0 we noticed *T*-1 last week that we had some new people move into our building E_S and , you know , the nice cardboard boxes that you move , packing boxes . And they were just used *-1 one time and thrown *-1 in the dumpster E_S
11200:20	And I do n't understand , sometimes , \[ \[ the way , \+ the thinking , \] \+ the logic \] behind it . E_S
11203:10	uh , someone moved offices in my building E_S
11285:17	but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids , E_S
11285:27	but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids , E_S
11310:14	You saved me some money . E_S
11354:29	and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category , E_S
11405:7	And somebody was writing in *-1 complaining that the people had , uh , dumped all the trash in the same bin . E_S
11410:47	or we did n't have time 0 * to do those bins *T*-1 or something E_S
11414:8	And someone else is n't going *-1 to take the time *-2 to put it in two separate bags . E_S
11429:45	I feel like I 'm \[ doing , \+ uh , doing \] something for the community when I 'm doing that *T*-1 . E_S
11524:19	in fact , it got some pretty serious deep parts in it E_S
11618:36	Um , I had a friend who *T*-1 had fixed some , uh , \[ chili , \+ buffalo chili \] \[ and , \+ \] about a week before * went *-2 to see the movie . E_S
11723:23	And I hope 0 you enjoy some more good movies late- , E_S
11746:80	and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , we , \] \+ we \] keep *-1 saying oh yes , we feel 0 some day a woman will be president . E_S
11747:21	But , uh , I have some question , whether or not they will ever really get around to that . E_S
11884:46	\[ There , \+ there \] must be , uh , uh , \[ some of the , \+ some of the , \] uh , larger plants \[ up , \+ uh , up \] around one hundred twenty-eight . E_S
11884:61	\[ There , \+ there \] must be , uh , uh , \[ some of the , \+ some of the , \] uh , larger plants \[ up , \+ uh , up \] around one hundred twenty-eight . E_S
11906:16	they could do something \[ \[ a- . \+ about , \] \+ about \] that , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
11938:28	\[ Up , \+ upstate \] New York somewhere , over huge areas , E_S
11945:70	and they thought 0 that was more beneficial because , you know \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ some of it \] does soak in E_S
11946:8	and some of it runs off right away \[ into the , \+ in to the \] streams and rivers E_S
11947:8	and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback . E_S
11952:32	\[ I , \+ I \] read that recently somewhere , E_S
11966:32	Um , you kind of think 0 it 's something else then ? E_S
12003:83	\[ \[ you ne- , \+ yo- , ne- , \] \+ I think 0 you need \] \[ a , \+ a \] vehicle something like , uh , Ralph Nader , Nader 's Raiders , \[ or , \+ \[ where , \+ \] uh , or , \] uh , uh , A A R P , which *T*-1 has a lot of members . Uh , if you can get those types of groups . E_S
12066:82	The , uh , United States and Canada \[ \[ are I guess , \+ is , \] \+ is , \] going into , uh , some types of agreements * to limit , uh , what *T*-1 's being given *-2 out by power plants , E_S
12096:49	I guess 0 the difficulty would be \[ * to , \+ \] that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again E_S
12097:46	so you probably would have *-1 to build it right into the muffler or something . E_S
12119:24	But if you was talking about something which *T*-1 was more or less universal that , uh , busses and any kind of vehicle , had *-2 to pay a pollution tax , uh , this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters , E_S
12134:38	But it *EXP*-1 should n't be too hard * to do something like that . E_S
12142:86	I do n't know \[ if you , \+ uh , if you \] approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on *-1 installing something like that . E_S
12150:26	well you might , uh , generate some N_S yeah , E_S you might generate some interest in it . E_S
12150:48	well you might , uh , generate some N_S yeah , E_S you might generate some interest in it . E_S
12153:16	the automobile regulatory agencies or something . E_S
12208:16	so it was n't something 0 I really wanted *-1 to make *T*-2 . E_S
12230:8	Humidity or something . E_S
12294:54	so I think 0 dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play *T*-1 , sometimes . E_S
12449:53	today the Turks , uh , agreed *-1 to support the Kurds , which *T*-2 is something 0 they 've never done *T*-3 before E_S
12479:52	I believe 0 he was the only one of fifty governors that *T*-1 voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back . E_S
12510:43	I mean , I 'd like *-1 to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region E_S
12510:59	I mean , I 'd like *-1 to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region E_S
12514:112	however , uh , every time 0 an organization such as the P L O says well we 'll see if we can work with Israel *T*-1 , then , uh , they get embarrassed *ICH*-2 \[ some , \+ \] every few months by documents that *T*-3 reveal that their ultimate purpose is * to totally eliminate them . E_S
12524:5	somebody 's going *-1 to , N_S
12525:145	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S

12722:80	but , uh , N_S but \[ I , \+ I 'd \] just love *-1 to be able *-2 to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music E_S
12871:6	Helen something . E_S
12913:29	and \[ he , \+ he \] likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah , E_S
12971:44	I think 0 my parents \[ have \+ have , \] uh , some of his records . E_S
12973:86	But , uh , \[ \[ I got a , \+ I 've \[ got about a hundred and , \+ or had \[ a , \+ uh , some , \] \] \] \+ uh ,
12974:12	I sold some of them ,
13002:18	and , uh , N_S some of those old ones *ICH*-1 , of course , Bob Wills , Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an , N_S
13091:14	You could kill somebody with them . E_S
13205:119	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 if you 've been out of school a \[ year , \+ year \] and a half , before you start to college , you appreciate college more , than someone that *T*-1 just goes right straight into college . E_S
13209:59	The only complication \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ is \] how do you fund something like this *T*-1 ? E_S
13212:19	There are , uh , some groups that *T*-1 have their children , you know , go away for a year . E_S
13222:54	It gets them away from home \[ and , \+ and \] gets them to do something useful , E_S
13224:29	\[ I , \+ we \] were doing some * investigating colleges
13225:87	and * said 0 the kids are much more interested *ICH*-4 today \[ in , \+ in \] * trying *-3 to find a job , study something that *T*-1 will give them a job as opposed to , \[ be curious , \+ be curious \] E_S
13251:65	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that they ought *-1 to have something for \[ the , \+ the \] unemployed in a voluntary field like the , uh , N_S
13261:24	but , uh , it gave them something 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
13263:27	Well , it seems that there 's some things like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] programs at least just go around \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] clean up streets \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things . E_S
13263:167	Well , it seems that there 's some things like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] programs at least just go around \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] clean up streets \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things . E_S
13326:20	and that is that N_S some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which I think 0 *T*-1 \[ is a , \+ is an \] invasion of privacy . E_S
13335:12	I get some of these things *ICH*-4 in the mail that I wonder , where in the world did they get my address *T*-2 or where did they get my name *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S
13339:17	And in fact , some of these things 0 I get *T*-1 , some of these questionnaires , N_S
13339:46	And in fact , some of these things 0 I get *T*-1 , some of these questionnaires , N_S
13344:38	\[ and , \+ and \] you hate *-1 to send something *ICH*-2 off with your name and address E_S and what types of things do you own *T*-1 E_S and what kind of money do you make *T*-1 E_S
13370:31	and you get , uh , a free trip or something along those lines . E_S
13384:8	but some of them are sold *-1 , E_S
13389:10	and for some , N_S the reason they have three different names for me . N_S
13429:60	The last thing 0 you want *T*-1 is a phone call unless it 's , you know , something halfway enjoyable , E_S
13430:34	but if it 's a salesperson , it 's just something 0 you do n't want *-2 to have *-3 to mess with *T*-1 . E_S
13433:5	sometimes I come home from work E_S
13487:28	and even though it 's friends calling , sometimes you just feel like , this is my quiet time , E_S
13496:5	sometimes \[ it is just , \+ I just want \] *-1 to get away from the phone ringing because \[ it , \+ it \] really does annoy me . E_S
13503:17	And if it 's some salesman , that just makes it even that much worse . E_S
13506:126	but now with this thing 0 I 'm participating in *T*-1 , I kind of have *-2 to answer it , because you never know if it 's the switchboard or if it 's , uh , you know , somebody calling that you really do n't want *-3 to talk on the phone . E_S
13548:44	is n't Tigon , uh , part of G T E or vice versa or something like that . E_S
13581:22	I knew 0 there was some type of a tie in there . E_S
13749:33	Maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , *-1 taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care *T*-2 . E_S
13783:98	Uh , I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures \[ on , \+ on \] the order of what I quoted *T*-1 to someone , because that 's \[ what \+ \] the experience 0 they want *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S
13843:33	and \[ that , \+ that \] is a little troublesome . Uh , because the pressures on them \[ are , \+ are , \] \[ rather , \+ rather \] formidable . E_S
13891:51	I think 0 they should either do that , \[ or , \+ or \] afford some time to the military , \[ or , \+ or \] *-1 helping elderly people . E_S
13897:97	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ you know , I \] think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that *T*-1 could use some help E_S
13999:44	and , uh , hopefully , we 'll have other good topic maybe another call someday , E_S
14005:89	\[ \[ It , \+ we , \] \+ I guess 0 we \] both agree that it 's a good thing , that they should do sometime . E_S
14166:31	I wondered if it would help 0 you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that \[ other people , \+ people like myself \] might not pick up on *T*-1 . E_S
14236:53	and the other thing 0 we have *T*-1 that I like *-2 to check *T*-3 sometimes is , um , TALKING FINGERS , E_S
14255:44	maybe our phone company out here will get around to , *-1 offering something like that . E_S
14259:16	So , that is something 0 you might keep your eyes open for *T*-1 , E_S
14341:10	and then somebody got injured *-1 E_S
14367:55	\[ Goin- , ke- , \+ he was going *-1 to keep \] him as the coach somehow , E_S
14369:39	I 'd like *-1 to see the Vikings get revamped *-2 somehow . E_S
14422:21	but I remember *-1 reading something *ICH*-2 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , \[ or , \+ or \] trying *-3 to go after somebody or trade for somebody , E_S
14422:49	but I remember *-1 reading something *ICH*-2 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , \[ or , \+ or \] trying *-3 to go after somebody or trade for somebody , E_S
14422:93	but I remember *-1 reading something *ICH*-2 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , \[ or , \+ or \] trying *-3 to go after somebody or trade for somebody , E_S
14422:104	but I remember *-1 reading something *ICH*-2 a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , \[ or , \+ or \] trying *-3 to go after somebody or trade for somebody , E_S
14529:18	They 've got \[ some , \+ lot \] of really good young players \[ that *T*-1 are going *-2 to , \+ that *T*-3 are going *-4 to , \] uh , do pretty good , I think 0 *T*-5 . E_S
14539:12	thirty bucks or something ? E_S
14550:18	And then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas , E_S
14566:40	And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , E_S
14567:71	and \[ they , \+ um , if they 're \] not going *-1 to use them they 'll give them to somebody else . E_S
14636:31	and he said , * sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes . E_S
14681:71	and what we have *-1 to do *T*-2 is , 0 we have *-3 to go , uh , *-4 get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it . E_S
14704:74	I mean , the thing \[ is \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right , E_S
14712:14	And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . E_S
14715:65	I mean , they do n't want the money \[ so , \+ uh , so \] they can do something else with it . E_S
14725:75	Well , but you know , \[ the , \+ the \] \[ strange thing , \+ uh , perhaps , not strange , but something that many people do n't realize *T*-1 , \] is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying *-2 to influence the high school kids , E_S
14745:78	we 're going *-1 to solve , try *-2 to solve the AIDS problem \[ while , \+ while , \] you know , some people are getting killed *-3 here and there E_S
14787:222	But the guy at the very top , the one \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] really making the millions and the millions is the one who *T*-3 also many times is part of the power structure , uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , and had the political uh , pull to \[ keep things from , \+ uh , keep \] the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing , E_S
14880:26	I guess 0 I 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them . E_S
14880:35	I guess 0 I 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them . E_S
14889:50	Well , I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something 0 I want *T*-1 . You know not need *T*-1 , want *T*-1 . E_S
14933:37	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] talked to some who *T*-1 's really had some bad experience E_S
14933:57	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] talked to some who *T*-1 's really had some bad experience E_S
14980:11	compared to some of the other ones . E_S
15062:22	That 's like * forcing someone to donate to a charity . E_S
15066:74	I mean , and it *EXP*-2 's nice * \[ to , \+ to \] try *-1 to teach young people \[ some , \+ some , \] uh , uh , civil , uh , consciousness ,
15066:82	I mean , and it *EXP*-2 's nice * \[ to , \+ to \] try *-1 to teach young people \[ some , \+ some , \] uh , uh , civil , uh , consciousness ,
15071:91	so , I 'd have *-1 to say that , uh , \[ it , \+ you know , the people who *T*-2 do it , \] well , some feel 0 it 's rewarding . E_S
15127:14	like I do some volunteer work here and there , E_S
15140:70	I could n't possibly commit a year or two of my life *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] go *-2 do something . E_S
15154:44	And * seems to me like the Peace Corps , E_S they send you someplace that there 's a lot of bugs *T*-1 MUMBLEx . E_S
15168:90	\[ W- , \+ I , \] I mean , \[ it would , \+ it *EXP*-2 would \] have *-1 to be tough * going somewhere 0 you do n't know the culture *T*-3 , usually , I guess 0 *T*-4 . E_S
15172:30	I think that maybe that 's why some people do it *T*-1 is , uh , * to see the other cultures \[ or , \+ you know and \] some of that . E_S
15172:97	I think that maybe that 's why some people do it *T*-1 is , uh , * to see the other cultures \[ or , \+ you know and \] some of that . E_S
15188:56	after a certain amount of years of service , these employees can take off like six months or something , for some type of sabbatical or \[ \[ some , \+ you know , some , \] \+ something \] like that . E_S
15188:66	after a certain amount of years of service , these employees can take off like six months or something , for some type of sabbatical or \[ \[ some , \+ you know , some , \] \+ something \] like that . E_S
15188:87	after a certain amount of years of service , these employees can take off like six months or something , for some type of sabbatical or \[ \[ some , \+ you know , some , \] \+ something \] like that . E_S

15196:16	So , it is something that I think , uh , you know , 0 even the larger organizations will support *T*-1 . E_S
15202:56	\[ it 's for , \+ I think , 0 at the same it 's for \] some people * to , you know , help them grow in other areas , E_S
15212:18	and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful \[ as , \+ as \] that kind of a time . E_S
15223:89	But I think 0 a lot of it 's , you know , when \[ the- , \+ \] people get older *T*-1 , they 'll do something like that . E_S
15225:38	I 'd probably have a different perspective if I actually knew someone that *T*-1 had gone into the Peace Corps . E_S
15243:92	Everybody 0 I know *T*-1 has been , N_S well , I 'm going *-1 to go *-2 get a \[ goo- , \+ good \] job and make some money and buy a nice car . E_S
15263:67	and I guess 0 \[ they , \+ they \] keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it . E_S
15293:19	she stuck my name on some list , E_S
15298:28	Um , I 've talked about camping with someone . E_S
15311:16	And I talked to someone about \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] uh , education system . E_S
15314:16	And I talked to somebody about credit card usage . E_S
15370:22	I think 0 I had some other , uh , like * staying in shape or working out . E_S
15374:24	I had *-1 to talk to someone about hobbies , E_S
15445:32	Now , I 've seen , you know , some different clips of it , um , E_S
15551:16	but I went with someone , E_S
15566:22	I think 0 I heard somebody talking about that
15567:22	she cuts his foot off or something , you know . E_S
15610:83	and \[ the , \+ the \] character \[ was , \+ you know , prior to that \[ had , \+ had \] been \] someone that *T*-1 had killed other people E_S
15659:22	well , now , we had some friends that *T*-1 went *-2 to see it E_S
15665:36	I think 0 they may be playing up um , some aspects of the movie that *T*-1 are n't the main aspects . E_S
15752:19	Now we 've let some people *ICH*-1 go , uh , that \[ wa- , \+ we , \] \[ was \+ \] found that drugs were used *-2 in *T*-3 their system . E_S
15758:20	Uh , if there 's some , uh , problem I know , N_S
15779:43	And then I also had a friend who *T*-1 was just around some people that *T*-2 were smoking cocaine . E_S
15812:6	some of the places *ICH*-1 now , um , like I B M do n't allow them smoking , you know \[ in , \+ in \] the plant . E_S
15845:53	because you 're endangering everybody 's lives \[ if you \+ if it 's \] something like that . E_S
15949:7	in some cases N_S
15964:42	I mean , and \[ they have , \+ they have \] some serious chemicals out there you know , E_S
15980:18	So I think 0 some \[ place , \+ you know , places \] like that , it should be like mandatory like , you know , \[ \[ on , \+ on a , \] \+ on a \] greater frequency than maybe , just , you know , paper pushers \[ like , \+ like \] I am *?* . E_S
16006:34	I guess 0 it was like eighty-four , eighty-five something like that . E_S
16094:35	that 's what it said * to discuss *T*-1 some
16118:30	and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham E_S
16119:28	and I was going *-1 to try something weird which , you know , N_S
16121:25	I was going *-1 to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue . E_S
16129:5	some people like swiss , um , E_S
16158:11	instead of something greasy or , N_S
16170:43	What I 've been doing *T*-1 when I get invited *-2 someplace and bring something *T*-3 , I make , uh , food kabobs . E_S
16170:51	What I 've been doing *T*-1 when I get invited *-2 someplace and bring something *T*-3 , I make , uh , food kabobs . E_S
16223:11	um , something 0 I do *T*-1 is a fruit , N_S \[ is , \+ \]
16227:51	and \[ \[ they , \+ they \] \+ MUMBLEx they \] go *-1 melt some chocolate chips , . E_S
16228:21	* Go *-1 buy me some strawberries . E_S
16258:63	\[ I think 0 the , \+ uh , actually I think 0 they \] get , um , some of them from South America . E_S
16310:28	they 're called *-1 moo goo leaves or something E_S
16324:6	some of them , they used *-1 to be a hundred dollars , E_S
16353:11	and MUMBLEx someone who *T*-1 's just going *-2 to make it first time , it 's , N_S
16365:41	you put , um , really good vanilla favoring *ICH*-1 in it and some butter E_S
16386:26	\[ Ri- , \+ \] I have some . E_S
16420:16	I mean , something 0 she had collected *T*-1 out of WOMAN 'S DAY or something . E_S
16420:53	I mean , something 0 she had collected *T*-1 out of WOMAN 'S DAY or something . E_S
16455:5	sometimes MUMBLEx I 'll put my after I pour that \[ into my , \+ back into my \] saucepan . E_S
16467:5	sometimes the cocoa is N_S
16479:14	and , um , some people do n't like \[ that , \+ that , \] film on the pudding E_S
16516:28	I was trying *-1 to think about some of my favorite people that I liked *T*-2 in music E_S
16548:27	\[ I , \+ I \] like some of his songs , though . E_S
16550:22	They 're just kind of sweet sometimes . E_S
16590:38	my mother got a piano E_S and , uh , vowed that someone in the family was going *-1 to learn , E_S
16597:7	but sometimes it *EXP*-1 makes you feel good * to sit down and play it . E_S
16660:146	and \[ you do n't , \+ because it does n't have words , you know , you do n't \] feel like , there 's anything 0 you have *-1 to remember *T*-2 , you know , as far as *-4 singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean *T*-3 E_S
16803:15	For East Texas or something ? E_S
16911:17	but there 's probably something else that *T*-1 might make you *?* . E_S
16916:77	I mean , pretty much a lot of people would know about it , you know , \[ and , \+ and \] know some of the different things about it E_S
16917:44	but , uh , \[ they , \+ they \] might weed you out some other way . E_S
16926:104	I said that , I could believe in it in certain instances , but \[ I would be , \+ I 'd find \] it *EXP*-1 hard * to levy that against somebody . E_S
16950:17	Well , especially with something where \[ you have *-1 to f- , \+ you have *-2 to find \] it beyond a reasonable doubt *T*-3 . E_S
17027:15	he 's written some children 's books as well E_S
17174:18	It 's that real , gruesome , horror stories . E_S
17246:8	For some reason that scared me more than anything . E_S
17338:17	and then he has some under , uh , another name . That he 's written *T*-1 . E_S
17367:44	and , after \[ I , \+ I \] graduated , I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through *T*-1 and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit , too , uh , E_S
17501:22	I 've , uh , Had some health problems that *T*-1 have led me to , uh , N_S
17535:35	\[ Do you go through this , \+ is this something that you go through *T*-1 \] every year . E_S
17552:21	I used *-1 to jog somewhat . E_S

17588:35	I need *-1 to start \[ * jog \+ something \] again . E_S
17660:63	Maybe if I can get interested in *-1 playing softball again this string I can , uh , start some type of , uh , regular program . E_S
17665:106	I 've always found that , uh , when you write things down and set goals *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 's a lot easier * to \[ keep , \+ uh , keep \] something going . E_S
17689:20	Well , that sounds like something good 0 * to do *T*-1 then . E_S
17691:15	* Sounds like something 0 I should do *T*-1 . E_S

17870:41	I have n't watch any other ones on T V . Just on some of the tapes . E_S
17936:38	I mean , if you 're going *-1 to sentence somebody , * let 's say *RNR*-2 twenty years , * let them stay twenty years . E_S
17941:27	but there has got *-1 to be some kind of punishment , For these people . E_S
17951:17	and then they do something worse E_S

18466:114	just if you want a lot of , you know , light for underneath , that may be \[ the , \+ \] all right because \[ \[ we had , \+ because we have some , \] \+ we have some \] old fruit trees . E_S
18466:131	just if you want a lot of , you know , light for underneath , that may be \[ the , \+ \] all right because \[ \[ we had , \+ because we have some , \] \+ we have some \] old fruit trees . E_S
18540:20	and they just , , have some \[ problems , \+ big time problems \] E_S
18601:25	they have *-1 to pay like some kind of fee per year . E_S
18611:7	and some places , \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really nail them for tax . E_S
18669:12	that 's something 0 I 've \[ been , \+ uh , been \] *-1 looking around and noticed *T*-2 0 all the flowering trees and stuff are , at this time of the year E_S
18679:111	\[ my , \+ my \] wife and I , \[ we planted \+ \[ on the , \+ on the \] south side \[ of our , \+ of our \] house we planted \] some gardenias . E_S
18722:34	\[ I , \+ I \] do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . E_S
18722:56	\[ I , \+ I \] do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . E_S
18722:70	\[ I , \+ I \] do , uh , some Lotus on it . Uh , do some , uh , Samna , some , uh , P F M , uh , nothing extremely complex . E_S
18791:25	I used it on , uh , some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased *-1 to leave it . E_S
18834:28	uh , E_S maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *T*-1 . E_S
18907:16	Well , that 's something E_S
18966:37	But I 'm sure that they can , uh , find some sort of , uh , use for them if , you know , you know , there , N_S
19133:33	So , you know , if we have branches or something , they have *-1 to be cut *-2 in four-foot lengths , E_S
19142:104	\[ They brought , \+ uh , the week after Christmas they left \] a plastic bag *ICH*-1 on everybody 's front doorknob with a little note on it saying , we 're trying something new next week only ,
19160:14	but , uh , something \[ nee- , \+ does need \] *-1 to be done *-2 about the Styrofoam that , uh , N_S
19175:22	And I 've seen where some places have taken a plastic *T*-3 and , uh , they 're recycling them into other plastics . And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that *T*-3 E_S
19179:43	and I think 0 that would be great if they could get something organized * along those lines . E_S
19189:72	and you 're not going *-1 to bother *ICH*-3 if you have one bag full , *-4 to drive all the way to some recycling center *-2 to turn in just your little plastic peanuts . E_S
19249:61	\[ it , \+ it \] takes awhile * \[ to , \+ to \] get used to something , E_S you know , \[ if , \+ if \] they have completely chain- , N_S \[ on \+ \] the , place has completely turned that much around to where they 're \[ not , \+ you know , not \] what they used *-2 to be *T*-1 *T*-3 , E_S
19275:23	we 're getting stuck *-2 into something here , you know , E_S
19276:24	\[ if , \+ if \] somebody 's about *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] clobber you , the first thing 0 they do *T*-1 is * sort of say , well , you know , \[ we 're , \+ we 're \] ashamed , 0 we 're not going *-2 to do that anymore . E_S
19285:67	the evidence is that , uh , you know , \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] let \[ some , \+ some \] stuff *ICH*-1 go , you know , the east German situation . E_S
19285:76	the evidence is that , uh , you know , \[ he 's , \+ he 's \] let \[ some , \+ some \] stuff *ICH*-1 go , you know , the east German situation . E_S
19303:14	it 's just some ungodly number * just to support the military machine . E_S
19334:131	and , you know , I even had a thought *ICH*-2 once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just \[ a , \+ a \] deal *-1 to go ahead and let us , uh , you know , expend \[ some , \+ some \] military hardware . E_S
19334:139	and , you know , I even had a thought *ICH*-2 once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just \[ a , \+ a \] deal *-1 to go ahead and let us , uh , you know , expend \[ some , \+ some \] military hardware . E_S
19362:30	\[ or , \+ or \] we can do something about it . E_S
19365:82	Whereas , you know , if the Soviet Union would have , who *T*-2 knows what taking over Mongolia \[ or , \+ or \] something like that , \[ who *T*-1 is really , \+ \] will we have been more just rhetoric , uh , rather than *-3 going in there officially or , you know , physically and try *-4 \[ to , \+ to \] remove them . E_S
19374:30	and all of a sudden it was like somebody \[ in the , \+ in the \] Red Square or wherever said , okay , E_S
19388:44	and I think 0 he 's actually , honestly trying *-1 to do some change . E_S
19395:26	Well , this would be like if somebody was elected *-1 president of the United States and suddenly took off toward , you know , just some pretty hard by the socialism , E_S
19395:82	Well , this would be like if somebody was elected *-1 president of the United States and suddenly took off toward , you know , just some pretty hard by the socialism , E_S
19448:8	And some of the countries that *T*-1 were forced *-3 in at \[ th- , \+ \] later dates is the three Baltic countries , you know , 0 *T*-2 came \[ in , \+ in \] the forties , E_S
19509:16	You know , some reason or other , you know , is , uh ,
19510:55	it *EXP*-2 's kind of a strange thing 0 we 've been trying *-1 to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens *T*-3 you say , whoa , * wait a minute , E_S
19543:12	they had some real fancy names for them . E_S
19579:6	something that *T*-2 's called *-1 \[ a , \+ an \] economic force or what *T*-3 is called *-4 a military pact , E_S
19585:23	you can change the name of something E_S
19590:19	Although , I 've seen some evidence that , you know , the , uh , the Russian soldiers are , N_S
19599:7	and somebody 's got *-1 to pay for their , N_S
19655:15	By , uh , somebody who *T*-1 was there E_S
19695:7	and somebody had given me one of these dinky do , crappy women 's novels set * in the Civil War , John Jakes with , N_S
19737:29	It was made *-2 * to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , \[ it was , \+ uh , if you read it , it only emancipated \] those who *T*-1 were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the United States . E_S
19768:12	where 's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played *T*-1 either leading up to *RNR*-2 or in *RNR*-2 the Civil War *T*-3 . E_S
19783:11	They supplied some , uh , you know , N_S
19784:13	they were some groups of it , the Vicksburg , E_S
19785:106	if you ever get a chance * to go over to Vicksburg , the battleground at Vicksburg , uh , there 's an area \[ there where \+ there was , \] uh , some Texas , uh , groups *T*-1 E_S
19849:18	It sounds like Iowa or something . E_S
19966:49	See , I had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago . E_S
19973:6	some of those get very philosophical E_S
19979:10	And then somebody said , oh , God , this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston E_S
20043:15	Um , well , some history , books are pretty scary , E_S
20089:20	Even better than JAWS and some of that ? E_S
20186:238	Well , I think 0 in a way , though , uh , uh , I also have , uh , an opposite point of view , which *T*-1 is , uh , 0 although I believe 0 we should , uh , permit , uh , you know , constant immigration into this country uh , \[ I think 0 we should , \+ uh , primarily for economic reasons , I think 0 we should \] have , um , some quotas , E_S
20214:27	There \[ are , \+ were \] some , uh , regulations *ICH*-2 over , E_S I do n't know whether they 're laws passed * \[ or , \+ or \] whatever they 're called *-4 *T*-1 , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases can not be excluded *-5 , uh , from , uh , immigration *T*-3 . E_S
20220:39	So I think 0 \[ in , \+ in \] \[ some as- , \+ some \] ways we are , uh , becoming a little too egalitarian \[ in that , \+ in that \] sense , E_S
20220:49	So I think 0 \[ in , \+ in \] \[ some as- , \+ some \] ways we are , uh , becoming a little too egalitarian \[ in that , \+ in that \] sense , E_S
20271:17	and I think that sometimes it 's \[ too easy of a , \+ I do n't know , to easy of an \] answer . E_S
20291:8	Seven point something . E_S
20350:32	I thought 0 maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there . E_S
20350:44	I thought 0 maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there . E_S
20373:33	Oh , were you really , trying *-1 to find someone at home ? E_S
20381:52	the MUMBLEx would always try *-1 to stump Jesus , try *-2 to give him something that *T*-3 would contradict himself , E_S
20396:34	they just wanted *-1 to try and catch him in something . E_S
20509:80	though the note is thirty years , she said 0 it 's going *-1 be paid *-2 off in twenty or twenty one years , or something like that . E_S
20761:27	Well , I know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , E_S
20765:24	I know 0 they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there . E_S
20769:130	when they first started *-2 doing that in the paper , \[ and \+ \] I read about that *T*-1 , E_S I was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time . E_S
20777:51	they 'll help you , recycle , because \[ we , \+ \] there is some bins , like behind Wal-Mart , that *T*-1 take some things . E_S
20777:80	they 'll help you , recycle , because \[ we , \+ \] there is some bins , like behind Wal-Mart , that *T*-1 take some things . E_S
20879:37	and so , you know , when I found out some places 0 * to take it *T*-1 *T*-2 , N_S
20880:33	and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there , E_S
20881:73	and I know that they 're going *-1 to use , you know , the money for that *-2 to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing . Put lights and stuff E_S
20885:112	so , you know , if I 'm not going *-1 to get the money for aluminum , I would just assume give it *ICH*-3 to the city of Flower Mound . 0 * to do something with *T*-2 , you know . E_S
20890:12	* Let somebody get something out of it . E_S
20890:18	* Let somebody get something out of it . E_S
20929:27	they would do that because at least somebody *ICH*-3 was getting the money out of it , you know . That *T*-1 was going *-2 to use it for good , E_S
20981:10	Well , some- , N_S
21056:15	but , uh , some of the crap that *T*-1 's on T V nowadays , it 's about . N_S
21081:38	and , you know , I do n't want them watching something that I do n't think 0 they should watch *T*-1 E_S
21159:16	I think 0 some of the tones of \[ the , \+ the \] daily prime time is questionable , E_S
21288:7	but sometimes it just , N_S
21294:51	in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some , you know , beautiful woman *T*-1 just because the idea that \[ he was , \+ his mind \] was on the ozone layer and , you know , global warming and all this other kind of stuff . E_S
21350:47	but I think 0 we wanted *-1 to see Dede *ICH*-2 there or somebody like her . E_S
21547:53	but when he gets married *-1 *T*-2 , then you do n't care any more or something like that , E_S
21704:17	So there 's always something . E_S
21712:29	If we 're not doing sports we go somewhere . E_S
21714:77	\[ Do you go , how about like for , \+ uh , do you go for long vacations , \] like a week or something when they have school off *T*-1 ? E_S
21800:73	uh , a very , uh , family thing , you know , made * , like * go *-1 skiing in Vermont or something . E_S
21835:37	it 's like yeah , we never threw a football or something E_S
21900:46	but , uh , \[ it 's just , \+ it 's just \] something that , you know , N_S
22048:11	Well maybe something will open up for you . E_S
22053:6	some of them are interested . E_S
22075:50	the subject \[ is , \+ is \] big city crime , which *T*-1 is something that I do n't have any first hand experiences about *T*-2 , E_S
22281:42	if I was going *-1 to go out and drink or do something , I would n't do it in front of my child . E_S
22302:61	I mean if the parents are n't supplying it , they 've got *-1 to get it from someone else from the schools , E_S
22345:44	it 's just because that I would be reminded *-1 every day of something that I do n't see *T*-2 , E_S
22405:5	someone might grab you , mess around with you , E_S
22453:44	You did n't get a big kick out of *-1 killing them like some people do ? E_S
22479:112	so , I have not done , uh , much \[ freshwater fishing oh , for , \+ you know , \[ lake , \+ lake \] fishing for \] bass and so forth but , uh , maybe some what they call *T*-1 brim and those sorts of things , but nothing , N_S
22516:19	It 's a rhythm or something . E_S
22530:17	That would have been something . E_S
22602:56	but mainly \[ I , \+ um , I \] want *-1 to say 0 I brought something home . E_S
22666:79	Of course what I used *-1 to like *-2 to do *T*-3 though is * go *-4 snorkeling for scallops *ICH*-5 in some of the bays , \[ or \+ uh , or \] \[ oy- , \+ for oysters . \] E_S
22692:30	So , we thought well , maybe there are some crab in here , E_S
22693:24	we 'll try *-1 to catch some crab . E_S
22694:47	So I got my chicken MUMBLEx and all my little net and everything , E_S and something , N_S
22696:5	something grabs and just runs with it . E_S
22733:57	I guess 0 the weirdest thing 0 I 've ever caught *T*-1 is , uh , in some of the inlets and the rivers around MUMBLEx Delaware . E_S
22778:89	\[ \[ \[ It was u- , \+ it really , \] \+ it did n't look like , \] \+ it looked like \] it was something out of the dark ages that *T*-1 just never died . E_S
22791:17	and then I felt something relatively heavy , E_S
22798:54	Well , on this subject , I really had n't had *-1 to deal with *-2 putting someone in there yet , E_S
22812:81	I would personally be the last resort you know , \[ I rea- , \+ \] you know if I had *-1 to put someone in there . E_S
22835:54	But , um , we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted *-1 to give him some medication * to sort of , you know keep him real out of it all the time E_S
22884:10	Well , sometimes you do n't have any other alternative E_S
22915:16	Outside 's awful deceiving sometimes you know . E_S
22968:14	Now there is some really nice ones . E_S
22969:26	There 's also , you know , some private ones , you know E_S
22973:59	but of course , I would never be able *-1 to afford *-2 to put my parents in something like that , you know , E_S
22981:73	and , uh , \[ what I , \+ another thing 0 I \] hate *-1 to see *T*-2 is when someone has a small amount of money , and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately *T*-3 . E_S
22997:45	like , they could put it in one of their children 's names or something you know . E_S
23028:35	and then on the other hand , I 've seen 0 some people go into the nursing home and * just so happy you know . E_S
23053:56	but I guess 0 once you get ill , then , you know , you really have some problems if you ca n't get around and do things . E_S
23170:19	but , you know , sometimes it 's just so , N_S
23171:117	* seems so much easier *ICH*-3 *-1 just to take it and throw it in the trash , and have them pick it up than it *EXP*-4 is *?* * to smash the cans and drive it some place * to have them . E_S
23211:28	I 'd have *-1 to check into something like that , because , I mean , we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here , you know , E_S
23212:31	but , um you know , occasionally we have some around , E_S
23233:5	sometimes , even with the newspaper they say 0 they 'll only take certain types of paper , you know , E_S
23264:36	I 'm sure 0 they 're probably doing that here some . E_S
23317:36	I guess 0 they still ship it out on barges somewhere . E_S
23320:28	it 's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere . E_S
23332:22	But , you 're right 0 sometimes it does seem like it 's more trouble than what it would be worth *T*-1 . E_S
23462:81	And I also like the unanimous decision because you have *-1 to persuade everybody *-2 to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody . E_S
23467:135	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition . E_S
23477:25	maybe there ought *-1 to be some kind \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , MUMBLEx N_S
23500:106	But the way 0 \[ our system , \+ our court system \] works *T*-1 , that guy is going *-2 to have *-3 to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time . E_S
23515:16	or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try *-1 to figure out what *T*-3 really happened . You know , a jury like that . E_S
23530:75	You know , maybe , instead of * being so quick *-1 to sue you , uh , if you have a disagreement with someone , instead of * tying up court and time and that kind of stuff , \[ maybe you \+ \[ nee- , \+ \] maybe you , \] N_S
23544:59	And * \[ let 's , \+ you know , let 's \] get rid *-1 of some of this harassment suing . E_S
23549:42	in the BIBLE it says , uh , 0 if you have something against somebody , * to go to them first , E_S and if that does n't work , then * to go *-1 get somebody , you know , a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them , E_S and if that does n't work , * to take it to the whole church .

E_S
23569:56	There 's \[ a , \+ a \] real name for that like the Judean law , or something like that . E_S
23576:17	It 's in there some place . E_S
23663:12	What are some of your favorite foods *T*-1 ? E_S
23667:30	I imagine 0 in Argentina you 've got some great foods . E_S
23674:35	\[ We got , \+ we got \] what some people call *T*-1 the best beef in the world . E_S

23873:17	I mean , that sometimes N_S
23895:103	And if you like Chinese food , you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some , uh , waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done , E_S

23945:10	Uh , some chopped up \[ scall- , \+ \] um , you know , slivers of scallions . And slivers of ginger .
23985:138	And if you take , uh , little pieces of pork *ICH*-2 and you fry them , like little cubes of pork .

24138:11	Um , something \[ that \+

24440:81	after about eighteen months of * talking about the year and a half training , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] something , you know , N_S

24597:29	If someone 's having personal problems *ICH*-2 for some reason that *T*-1 's causing them to \[ h- , \+ \] behave differently E_S
24604:17	I mean if someone assumed that of me , I would be upset . E_S
24612:84	\[ \[ and , \+ and \] it 's \+ and it 's \] based *-4 \[ on , \+ on \] a perception \[ that someone has *T*-3 \+ \] as how a drug user would behave *T*-2 when some drug users behave , uh , normal *T*-1 , uh , you know . E_S

24638:25	So see \[ I , \+ for some reason , I 've \] come up three times . E_S
24641:105	Well , \[ does your r- , \+ does your job require \] you to drive company equipment or to \[ ap- , \+ operate \] any type of machinery that *T*-1 might endanger someone ? E_S
24803:52	Well , that 's really too bad because \[ it , \+ it 's \] giving some people unfair advantage . E_S
24828:23	and there are a few in some of the more , like in N_S
24830:9	and some of \[ the , \+ the \] better parts of the Metroplex , \[ the , \+ the \] suburbs that *T*-1 are richer have those kind of target schools . E_S
24834:125	it 's like \[ if , \+ if \] your father owns a grocery store and you 're really interested in that , E_S there 's no reason that you should take college prep courses *T*-1 when you can get some general business courses in high school *T*-2 . E_S
24878:26	and , you know , there 's some kids that , you know , *T*-1 want *-2 to go *-3 learn , E_S
24924:93	Because I know 0 the town that I come from *T*-1 \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ uh , the \] large I B M plant has something 0 * to do *T*-2 with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one E_S
24943:14	I can see some lady , E_S
24991:33	maybe \[ we do , \+ we need \] some more Catholic schools , E_S
24994:15	In , uh , some places , uh , you could n't go to a public school . E_S
25026:25	My engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T . E_S
25042:19	Uh , we also have some two year college . E_S
25063:162	and there are going *-1 to be people who *T*-2 die because of it because they do n't understand , uh , you know , simple things from the amount of medicine 0 they should take *T*-3 to how fast they can drive *T*-4 and you know how far away something is *T*-5 E_S
25073:42	our people are n't going *-1 to understand what an amount of something is *T*-2 . E_S
25102:16	and I 'm not some kind of an idiot , E_S
25267:24	and we were talking about \[ something tot- , \+ \] income tax or something . E_S

25286:55	\[ The , \+ uh , the \] Bermuda grass is greening up in March , E_S and sometimes does n't really start *-1 doing that until the first part of April . E_S
25303:88	Well , um , oh , I guess 0 another thing 0 I 've noticed *T*-1 , too , here lately is that even though we 've had some pretty warm days , it 's been awfully gray , you know , just , N_S
25347:64	Well , I like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there *T*-1 . E_S
25370:30	they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather . You know E_S
25508:57	and , uh , we 'll get out of the driving range \[ and , \+ and \] get some interest built *-1 up E_S
25615:61	it 's , \] \+ it 's \] a lot of fun , especially if you can find somebody \[ that *T*-1 's , \+ uh , that *T*-2 's \] got the same level of interest . E_S
25631:46	\[ and , \+ and \] people do n't want *-1 to play with somebody that they are going *-2 to beat *T*-3 every time , you know E_S
25637:32	And then , you know , we 've got some guys here that *T*-1 they are , you know , four and five handicappers E_S
25642:38	\[ so . \+ You know , but \] * get somebody around your own handicap ,

25808:35	but , you know I 'd get upset about it sometimes , E_S
26017:22	And interest is like eighteen or something . E_S
26087:51	Well , * \[ Having , \+ having \] been out of the credit game for some years now , I 've gotten used to *-1 either paying in cash or not getting it . E_S

26397:69	So , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do not , uh , opt for , uh , something that *T*-1 would be , you know , expensive you know , E_S

26760:65	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ that way , \+ *-1 handling it that way \] they could probably get some results out of it . E_S

26772:27	Most of them probably would n't do something like that . Although there are a lot of kids who *T*-1 would do it *-2 just to get away from their parents . E_S
26781:37	But , they would have *-1 to be supported *-2 in some way , E_S
26792:39	or would they really , you know , make a contribution of some kind . E_S
26840:54	and \[ you , \+ you \] give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something , E_S
26844:30	and , I think , that they could get some results from that , because there are a lot of people who *T*-1 are volunteer and community minded , E_S
26954:16	they call it something else . E_S
26967:28	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] sometimes wonder if I did n't mess up . E_S
27002:15	I 've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy *T*-1
27021:74	Um , but \[ now , \+ nowadays \] \[ they ca n't even , \+ they can barely \] scold the children for something , you know , without * getting sued . E_S
27054:95	well * let 's just say 0 he was one of \[ th- , \+ those \] types that you would n't doubt that *T*-1 he was selling something . E_S
27063:72	and if we did have \[ a , \+ a \] student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of * calling the police and have them taken *-1 out of the schools or trying *-2 to teach them something while they were there . E_S
27063:148	and if we did have \[ a , \+ a \] student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of * calling the police and have them taken *-1 out of the schools or trying *-2 to teach them something while they were there . E_S
27081:6	some of them were even better behaved . E_S
27084:33	I do n't know if * was alcohol or something else that they were on *T*-1 E_S
27091:11	it 's something . E_S
27106:95	I mean , \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] indicative across the board that \[ we , \+ we 've \] done something wrong . E_S
27135:46	But \[ there , \+ there \] definitely needs *-1 to be a balance somewhere . E_S
27173:11	And consequently some of the very best students \[ were , \+ had \] excellent memories E_S
27268:79	\[ I mean , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] mean \] teachers are so afraid *ICH*-4 now of * even saying something , to students because \[ they 're going get , \+ they 're going *-1 to get \] complaints or they 're going *-2 to get sued *-3 or something . E_S

27333:52	You have *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] prove that you 're teaching them something . E_S
27346:32	And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that . E_S
27358:66	I remembering *-2 reading a few cases about \[ that \+ \[ when it , \+ when \] \] some people first tried that *T*-1
27412:45	I need *-1 to , uh , either paper back over it or do something . E_S
27441:39	\[ and , \+ and \] it supposedly textured it or did something to it E_S
27448:12	It was something like that ,
27459:18	I was talking to somebody else \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 had a lot of wood panelling E_S
27460:24	and , uh , they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate E_S
27462:43	and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars *ICH*-1 *-2 to paint it or something . E_S
27467:82	\[ Have you , \+ have you \] tried *-1 getting outside estimates *-2 to see what it *EXP*-4 costs *T*-3 * to have something painted *-5 ? E_S
27515:40	\[ and , \+ uh , and , \] in fact she put some right ba- , N_S
27519:36	and it does it , uh , oh , electronically \[ some , \+ something , \] magic . E_S
27519:44	and it does it , uh , oh , electronically \[ some , \+ something , \] magic . E_S
27536:16	and then they wanted some gray \[ * to do the , \+ *-1 to do the \] trim . E_S
27545:21	this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something E_S
27702:11	you get some , N_S
27714:77	but \[ the , \+ the \] interesting thing is 0 that paint we wound up *-1 having *-2 to go back and scrape some of that away E_S
27784:137	I think 0 \[ with , \+ \] in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend , uh , *-1 to have a dramatic or story approach to their music , uh , usually tend *-2 to have some good or bad moral to it . E_S
27791:12	it 's something that *T*-1 interests me , uh , combined \[ with , \+ with \] the classical tastes 0 I had mentioned *T*-2 . E_S
27803:14	I listen to some country and western E_S
27810:100	but when I do play , uh , and begin *-4 to reacquire skills *T*-5 I inevitably fall in love with country western music which *T*-1 tends *-2 to be in some ways easy 0 * to play *T*-3 \[ for a , \+ for a \] new piano player . E_S
27816:78	And \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \[ pretty , \+ fairly \] well easily \[ to \+ uh , uh , something 0 * to \] fall into *T*-1 . E_S
27827:8	for some reason \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] not a whole lot of his stuff that I 'm real crazy about *T*-5 , E_S
27828:16	but he does have some things . E_S
27829:11	Chicago had some things , E_S
27833:39	uh , and I think 0 even Electric Light Orchestra had \[ some , \+ some \] real , um , influences by classical music E_S
27833:47	uh , and I think 0 even Electric Light Orchestra had \[ some , \+ some \] real , um , influences by classical music E_S
27838:29	I find it *EXP*-2 very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy *T*-1 I particularly like the music . E_S
27894:71	and I have , uh , returned about every four or five years to *-2 thinking that I would like *-1 to do something about it . E_S
27895:38	I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes *T*-1 E_S
27912:16	keys and things are something *ICH*-1 to me that *T*-2 remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang *T*-3 on them . E_S
27917:63	uh , but \[ in a , \+ in a \] innate music sense there just seems *-1 to be something missing * there which *T*-2 is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude E_S
27940:52	\[ I just , \+ you know , I can just \] drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time 0 * to do that *T*-2 , E_S
27947:14	I 'll do something with the piano , E_S
27950:40	So we both have a secret background that *T*-1 says 0 somehow or another we just knew 0 we were piano players and never got a chance , uh , E_S
27987:47	And if you really pushed it , you taught until you had kids or something you know , E_S
28034:149	I could n't put in enough overtime that *T*-1 was necess- , or \[ that , \+ \] you know , things that *T*-2 would come up at work , that *T*-3 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays \[ as * is , \+ you know , as * is \] needed *-4 , because my husband for a long time was out of the country also \[ with , \+ uh , with \] work , for like three months E_S
28076:15	you 've found something else . E_S
28093:15	And I wanted something else 0 * to do *T*-1 , E_S
28123:21	\[ And , \+ and \] someone 's got *-1 to do it , and be able *-2 to do it right , E_S
28124:56	\[ and \+ and \] if it 's not mom \[ then , \+ then \] dad or somebody 's got *-1 to move in there and do the job , because the kids really need it . E_S
28139:163	Because \[ if , \+ if \] I had been allowed *-1 to work , you know , maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week , I might still be working basically full time or part time , \[ if there was , \+ if there had been \] some way 0 *-3 to work it out *T*-2 , E_S
28201:190	Because if he saw mom doing only that you know , all the time 0 he was growing up *T*-1 then it *EXP*-2 's hard * to think of it \[ in \+ \] \[ that , other , \+ uh , that I \] should do it or just to think about * doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it . E_S
28219:76	I know 0 that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something *-1 to help , and even though we were both working the same number of hours , \[ and , \+ and \] doing things , I had *-2 to come in there specifically and say this needs *-3 to be done *-4 , E_S
28244:163	And I think 0 most women walk in \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] with , Oh , * got *-1 to clean all this up .

28256:45	Which *T*-4 brings us back to the idea , you know , 0 someone 's got *-5 to be there *-6 taking care of the kids *-6 to \[ drill in these \+ you know , drill in the \] right ideas to , so that they know that , uh , you know , male and female are both responsible for *-1 doing this E_S
28305:5	some kids are really having it . N_S
28308:47	the ones that *T*-1 are now getting *-2 to be teenagers and in some cases , young college . E_S
28311:20	Un , you know some time day care is really good , E_S
28315:7	but sometimes , \[ it 's just , \+ it 's \] baby-sitting . E_S
28319:12	It 's someone , you know , keeping an eye on the kids E_S
28342:60	I 'm saying this as I 'm trying *-1 to keep my nine month old from *-2 trashing something . E_S
28366:25	\[ Some of the , \+ some of the \] women 's roles , I think 0 *T*-2 , are almost for the worse , because we 're losing out on some things , *-1 going back to work , E_S

28547:48	and you had *-1 to take your diskette to the P C *-2 to print something . E_S
28593:21	So if I just need something real quick , \[ and \+ \] I do n't feel like *-2 getting up and going and getting what I printed *T*-1 , E_S
28617:29	And we , uh , got a quote on some laser printers *ICH*-1 the other day at six hundred dollars . E_S
28666:49	\[ we \+ you 'd \] have *-1 to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer . E_S
28727:42	We find it \[ hard 0 * to believe *T*-2 *ICH*-4 sometimes , \+ or hard 0 * to understand *T*-1 \] when , uh , we work for a computer company *T*-3 , and , uh ,
28732:27	and \[ the guys that , \+ some of the guys that \] *T*-1 run this place are very tight E_S
28754:51	I used *-1 to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall . E_S
28887:5	sometimes it 's kind of * shoot yourself in the foot \[ short- , \+ \] MUMBLEx mentality * to save a few bucks . E_S
29024:72	I mean , uh , * to add dependents \[ is , \+ is \] you know , maybe another dollar or something E_S
29092:11	I learned something here . E_S
29130:5	something 's wrong . E_S
29145:20	They 're not saying that something 's wrong with the educational system here in Texas , E_S
29152:64	\[ hope , \+ hopefully \] the new , uh , \[ education , \+ secretary of education \] will do something * to fix the problem E_S

29198:51	then it comes down to what you said *T*-1 before though about them being some of the lowest paid \[ public , \+ you know , public \] service , employees that there are *T*-2 , E_S
29226:97	Goodness gracious , if we would , uh , plan our expressways a little better , that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads , we 'd cut that in half and get some teachers
29245:55	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 we both agree 0 there 's some problems there E_S
29291:60	And then , you know , usually over lunch , there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news . E_S
29320:36	So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch . E_S
29322:35	I will admit 0 I work with , uh , someone who *T*-1 's Iranian , E_S
29366:36	and they go back and forth , where everyone 's giving some opinions *T*-1 E_S
29367:7	and sometimes that , N_S
29390:27	\[ and , \+ and \] they shed some light on what *T*-1 was going on for me . E_S
29395:70	Um , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 \] was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe 0 * to grind *T*-1 , you know , E_S
29396:12	there were some that *T*-1 were screaming for air power , E_S
29397:12	there were some that *T*-1 were saying 0 the air power was n't going *-2 to do it . E_S
29440:38	but they were free rental , videos , that *T*-1 had something 0 * to do *T*-2 with the war . E_S
29452:12	It was something for children , that \[ they , \+ they \] had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and , uh , getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing . E_S
29555:18	and the other one has some weird ones that I 've never heard of *T*-1 . E_S
29611:26	People say * let me see some of your work . E_S
29627:33	\[ That , \+ that \] would be definitely something 0 you 'd want *-1 to keep *T*-2 . E_S
29649:11	I did some needlepoint years ago , E_S

29748:14	I 've seen some , E_S
29755:27	So it 's got *-1 to be something 0 she can do *T*-2 fairly easily and fairly quickly . E_S
29766:17	and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped *-1 in *T*-2 and then , um , allowed *-1 to dry in \[ \[ those , \+ those draping bows , \] \+ I mean , those draping streamers . \]
29772:26	There 's bound *-1 to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that *T*-2 's very similar that *T*-3 's not going *-4 to melt too much with , uh , uh , high humidity , in a room , E_S
29813:11	I do some , N_S
29842:81	I started a project , it 's been over a year ago that I swore 0 I was going *-1 to finish *T*-2 for somebody for Christmas . E_S
29874:24	but I decided that that 's something that *T*-1 demands \[ my tim- , \+ \[ my , \+ my \] total \] attention . E_S
29919:62	or do you go out an buy \[ a , \+ a \] kit , like for a bib or something like that . E_S
29936:8	But some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , I just go with whatever I want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S
29996:91	Plus \[ it , uh , has , \+ you know , from an economic point of view it has \] increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion , I believe 0 *T*-1 E_S
30015:27	I think 0 it was like twenty something cents interest , on our Visa . E_S
30053:200	I know 0 \[ when I travel *T*-1 , \+ or when I used *-2 to travel overseas quite a bit *T*-3 , \] what I would do *T*-4 on my American Express card is \[ before I would , \+ before I left \] I would mail a check \[ to , \+ to \] American Express and , you know , have some idea of how much *T*-5 was there , you know ,
30076:27	\[ Sometimes , \+ you know , sometimes \] I would go over , E_S
30223:41	\[ I , \+ I 've \] been doing it for twenty some odd years . E_S
30326:27	We have , you know , used some of it for some personal things . E_S
30326:39	We have , you know , used some of it for some personal things . E_S
30363:74	\[ Then , \+ you know , then , \] we thought , well we can use it for , you know , some personal things . E_S
30373:28	and , you know , it 's got some stuff on it . E_S
30374:49	It 's got a nice little word processing software on it , you know , and some budgeting type things and stuff . E_S
30379:53	\[ It just , \+ it just \] seems like a lot of trouble for something at home . E_S
30428:15	there are \[ some \+ definitely , \[ some , \+ some \] \] advantages to it . E_S
30428:30	there are \[ some \+ definitely , \[ some , \+ some \] \] advantages to it . E_S
30428:39	there are \[ some \+ definitely , \[ some , \+ some \] \] advantages to it . E_S
30434:10	Not unless somebody really enjoys it . Or perhaps is using it for education . E_S
30439:14	and we have some education programs that he likes *T*-1 . E_S
30532:36	I mean , E_S and then of course you have some changes 0 * to make *T*-1 , and do the whole thing over . E_S
30554:42	then , when , \[ where , \+ \] you know , someone would have you type a letter *T*-1 , \[ they did it right , \+ they did it right . \] E_S
30579:54	but , you know , \[ it , \+ it \] gets a little out of hand sometimes . E_S
30610:167	You know , I mean , that 's the kind of things , you know , that she 's keeping *T*-1 and showing , that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it *EXP*-2 was a waste , you know * to change something like that . E_S
30614:74	So . Anyway , \[ maybe , \+ you know , maybe \] \[ it 'll , \+ it 'll \] help in some way , E_S
30622:38	Well , I would like *-1 to get one at home some day . E_S
30624:22	and so , you know , some day I would like *-1 to get , even just like the video \[ tell , \+ \] or something like that , you know ,
30624:80	and so , you know , some day I would like *-1 to get , even just like the video \[ tell , \+ \] or something like that , you know ,
30720:69	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] it 's a huge eagle , you know , wing span of twenty feet or something like that . E_S
30725:73	And I mean , I know 0 \[ they , \+ there \] must have \[ used , \+ been \] computers or something for animation this day , E_S
30750:94	\[ \[ He was , \+ he 's \] \+ of course , uh , I guess 0 he 's \] trained in this , uh , martial arts of some sort , E_S

30806:75	\[ It was really , \+ I mean the Hollywood really must \] think 0 there 's some real dummies out there or something . E_S
30921:13	but they changed some things in the movie . E_S
30969:26	A , uh , special effects man who somehow *T*-1 gets involved *-2 in this , um , N_S
30973:38	But \[ he , \+ he \] gets involved *-1 in some sort of bad dealings with somebody E_S
30973:54	But \[ he , \+ he \] gets involved *-1 in some sort of bad dealings with somebody E_S
31013:16	Well , they had some , N_S
31014:9	in some of those , you know , \[ they , \+ I guess they \] retitled some movies that *T*-1 were going *-2 to be about Lebanese \[ \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] Americans E_S

31042:25	they probably do the story of someone who *T*-1 was shot *-2 down early in the war or something and how he survived *T*-3 \[ \[ or , \+ or about , \] \+ or about \] those two newsmen or whatever that *T*-4 got captured *-5 . E_S

31115:59	And , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I 've , \] in hindsight , seen some things that I wished that , you know , I had done something about *T*-1 that *T*-3 was , you know , within my power or , uh , you know , wish that in some ways we , as parents , had more control over what *T*-2 's happening up there , you know , type thing .

E_S
31128:69	and I was never one 0 *T*-2 to believe everything 0 my kids said *T*-1 , you know , about something . E_S
31131:48	But , uh , still \[ I , \+ I \] questioned the ability of some of the teachers * to , uh , really do a bang-up job , E_S
31140:7	And somebody said , well , you know , you could go in \[ and , \+ and \] substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day E_S
31141:42	and there 's always going *-1 to be , you know , somebody having a need for a math or science teacher . E_S
31160:144	In fact , I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the big problems today is \[ the , \+ the \] way 0 the kids behave or act *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] the way 0 they are sometimes disinterested in what *T*-1 's going on in the class and disruptive *T*-3 . E_S
31191:38	and I would imagine 0 their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases . E_S
31205:48	the people that *T*-2 took , you know , the lower level courses , I sometimes wondered , you know , are they really even educatable or trainable E_S
31208:111	are the rest of us who *T*-1 went for the big bucks , you know , staying out of , you know , where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated *-2 to spend some time *-4 teaching or something with these kids *T*-3 ? E_S
31208:126	are the rest of us who *T*-1 went for the big bucks , you know , staying out of , you know , where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated *-2 to spend some time *-4 teaching or something with these kids *T*-3 ? E_S
31215:25	Maybe there need *-1 to be some radical changes made * . E_S
31216:12	* Do some things that *T*-1 are totally different and unheard of . E_S
31255:86	and while it had , you know , a few little grammatical problems , it was n't very long and so forth . E_S I thought 0 it had some nice , well thought out , uh , parts to it . E_S
31261:25	and you give them an F on something that *T*-1 does n't seem that bad to me . E_S
31279:55	And if they ca n't *?* , I mean if they have missed that training , then somebody , you know , before \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] start *-4 penalizing them with bad grades for *-2 not being able *-3 to communicate what they 're thinking *T*-1 , teach them these basic skills . E_S
31312:103	And I keep *-1 thinking , you know , \[ it 's not , \+ it 's really not \] too late *ICH*-2 at any point * to do , you know , some- , N_S
31314:36	That 's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it . E_S
31414:30	I agree \[ that , \+ that \] some innocent person might be victimized *-1 , by a false test , E_S
31418:40	but I would think \[ that , \+ um , that \] some guidelines could be set *-1 up * to avoid that . E_S
31427:43	On the other hand , um , I think 0 there 's certainly some professions that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because \[ of the , \+ of their \] responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , \[ for spe- , \+ uh , you know , specifically . \] E_S
31446:105	I guess 0 \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] would not want *-1 to have anyone in my family , uh , victimized *-4 by \[ someone who , \+ you know , \[ a , \+ a \] bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , \] um , you know , *T*-2 had n't been tested *-3 . E_S

31471:13	and it takes some drastic steps at this point . E_S
31560:27	and there needs *-1 to be \[ some , \+ some \] measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . E_S
31560:36	and there needs *-1 to be \[ some , \+ some \] measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . E_S
31564:103	There are lots of things that *T*-1 are involved *-2 there , um , such as , perhaps , \[ insurance \+ uh , you know , denial of insurance \] for someone , um , E_S
31577:65	so it seems to me \[ that , \+ that , \] um , there needs *-1 to be \[ some ground , \+ you know , some rules \] that *T*-2 protect . E_S
31577:86	so it seems to me \[ that , \+ that , \] um , there needs *-1 to be \[ some ground , \+ you know , some rules \] that *T*-2 protect . E_S
31604:11	would be some measure of protection . N_S
31611:69	Well , \[ \[ there 's , \+ yeah , there , \] \+ there 's \] going *-1 to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever , E_S
31697:38	I told my husband , I said , you go out some * to work on the car , E_S
31699:38	I says , you go *-1 pay *-2 to have someone do it . E_S
31703:51	Because it always seems 0 it goes wrong when you try *-1 to do something *T*-2 . E_S
31854:14	And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with , uh , dried red flowers and dried white flowers and , uh , eucalyptus . E_S
31878:29	I 'd walk into a room where some of that , N_S
31894:43	Is that the stuff 0 that koala bears eat *T*-1 in Australia or something ? E_S
31900:35	I guess 0 they 're stoned on the stuff or something . E_S
31924:29	You know , after a while you make some stuff , E_S
31929:14	But I know someone who *T*-1 does a lot of woodworking for a hobby . E_S
31942:39	and his , uh , son built him a garage and got him some , uh , oh , I do n't know what the equipment 's called *-1 *T*-2 , but planers and things and \[ s- , \+ set \] him up , E_S
31959:63	You know , \[ they 've , \+ they 've \] got twelve weeks 0 * to do something *T*-1 , E_S
31981:71	but he 's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost , * \[ to , \+ to \] do something like that *T*-1 . E_S
31986:59	I could n't imagine *-1 taking \[ lumber , \+ raw lumber \] and trying *-2 to make something out of it . E_S
32003:30	\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] something . E_S
32008:142	\[ \[ \[ and , \+ uh , so , \] \+ and , \] \+ uh , so \] as far as , you know , planting outdoor stuff , matter of fact , tonight \[ I just got through , \+ I was planting \] \[ some , \+ some \] trees out back tonight , E_S

32228:25	I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe , E_S
32417:95	If I have a problem discipline , you know , I think , E_S now , boy , I really need *-1 to get out , you know , and apply something , you know , E_S
32418:42	and I screw around and do n't do it or wait too long or something . E_S
32425:39	and all of a sudden you 've got *-1 to do something else . E_S
32516:20	Next year I was planting some broccoli \[ and , \+ and \] some of those , they 're called *-2 \[ cabbage , \+ *RNR*-1 cabbage \] loppers , or whatever . E_S

32581:12	I did something a little bit different *ICH*-2 this year that I have n't done *T*-1 before , E_S
32643:47	When we had our pool done *-1 *T*-2 I had them to leave some extra loam , you know , for my garden E_S
32682:24	And it weighs twenty pounds or , something like that . E_S
32734:49	We 've had a garden *ICH*-1 , gosh , for years and years and years , of some size , you know , E_S
32738:45	I ca n't remember a year when we did n't have one of some kind *T*-1 . E_S
32748:16	and I 've got some radishes up , E_S
32784:16	But we 've got some this year . E_S
32846:12	We let some turn red . E_S
32852:7	And some we do *T*-1 *-2 green E_S
32873:11	We planted some yellow peppers this year . E_S
32884:11	They have some little buds on them
32885:17	hopefully they 'll do something . E_S
32895:17	and I 've got some broccoli , uh , onions \[ some , \+ some \] radishes and , uh , uh , beets . E_S

32962:33	I do n't know unless it , labor intensive or something . E_S
32978:53	I 'd like *-1 to \[ try , \+ you know , just try \] something new *ICH*-2 , every year that , I have n't tried *T*-3 before E_S
33031:42	But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like , uh , N_S
33078:24	But , um , you just put some Cajun , well , lots of pepper E_S
33084:63	but \[ there 's , \+ uh , they 're \] a pain 0 * to peel *T*-1 for some people . E_S
33101:37	you know , we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something E_S

33208:10	it something unique you know E_S
33209:63	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food Or um sometimes it would be um oh Oh I do n't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know N_S
33216:7	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something E_S
33216:33	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something E_S

33252:15	make hot dogs or some potato chips E_S
33313:50	one of the unique things in this it 's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings E_S
33318:43	so salt and pepper Um and chopped up water chestnuts which *T*-1 is something different um E_S
33331:14	and that adds something new to it E_S
33440:12	I got some interesting information about crawfish E_S
33563:29	And as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it . E_S
33600:35	I was off for about six months too just for some other surgery 0 I 'd had *T*-1 , E_S
33710:23	Um , but when I see some wo- , N_S
33719:33	this was just , I guess 0 *T*-2 , something freak that *T*-1 happened to me , E_S
33788:49	\[ he says , \+ he said , \] uh , you 're at thirty something , E_S
33824:10	There some things 0 I 'd like *-1 to try *T*-2 , E_S
33825:19	but , you know , sometime when I ask *T*-1 , I just feel like , boy , am I stupid or what . E_S
33836:12	there was some girl there . E_S
33848:10	um , sometimes I feel like I 'm in a singles bar . E_S
33892:22	so I mean aerobics is something 0 I 'd hate *-2 to give *T*-1 up . E_S
33893:34	But \[ he , \+ he \] kind of said something *ICH*-1 to me about probably not as bad as your foot , E_S

33938:32	I need * to go actually *-1 get something 0 * to eat *T*-2 here . E_S
34010:200	I think , you know , 0 one of the things \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] *T*-1 needs *-2 to happen is , uh , * \[ to , \+ to \] stop the impulse buyer from , uh , *-3 buying it quickly \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it . E_S
34013:11	But if someone 's really determined *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place . E_S
34037:54	Because \[ if , \+ if \] you 're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think 0 \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-3 to have some idea as to what you 're going *-4 to do *T*-5 with it . E_S

34113:39	You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have , uh , competition . E_S
34133:36	In fact , I 'd like *-1 to see 0 somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon *T*-2 you have * to , uh , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class * to know how * to handle that weapon *T*-3 . N_S

34142:84	even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how * to handle it *T*-1 , it 's just like * putting someone *ICH*-4 in an automobile that *T*-2 does n't know how * to drive *T*-3 . E_S
34154:42	and , uh , this one guy decided *-1 to play , uh , lonesome cowboy or something . E_S

34159:38	\[ He could , \+ he could \] of hit something else . E_S
34184:41	But , uh , I think 0 there ought *-1 to be some rule against it . E_S

34333:12	Control is something that I would n't want the Federal government to have *T*-1 . E_S
34467:48	but it was on a higher level , you know , where there were some things that kids did n't understand *T*-1 that adults did *T*-2 *T*-3 , E_S
34511:8	but something on the tip of my tongue , E_S
34581:32	and \[ there were , \+ there were \] some definite , um , should I say *RNR*-1 , tense moments , with him in there . E_S

34829:125	See , \[ that 's the one , \+ that is \] \[ the \+ honest to God the \] one reason 0 I do n't want *-1 to see the movie *T*-2 is because I love buffalos for some weird reason , E_S
34849:14	We really need some , E_S
34971:45	\[ I , \+ I \] have a hard time *-1 sticking with something \[ like , \+ like \] on T V , because , \[ it , \+ like , it \] gets real aggravating if you miss it , for a week or two . E_S

35091:90	and , you know , their demographic studies that they do *T*-2 that *T*-1 show , you know , that everybody 's I Q has dropped dramatically or something . E_S
35099:36	\[ I sit , \+ I sit \] and watch some shows , E_S
35127:39	And if they saw us watching \[ the , \+ \] something , E_S they 'd say , all right , what did you see *T*-2 on WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW , E_S
35128:13	or there was some other , N_S
35357:12	We found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway E_S
35372:76	and it *EXP*-3 just seems *-1 to make sense to me *-2 to get the most car for your money * to get something like that . E_S
35457:23	\[ or \+ , or \] is something wrong with it E_S
35484:36	About how much do they charge *T*-1 *-2 to do something like that , E_S
35533:49	and , uh , if I consider *-1 going the used car route and save up some money , I should n't have too much trouble at all . E_S
35544:26	and I was picking up , uh , some background noise , E_S
35622:63	But , you know , that 's a sign that I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to do something sooner or later . E_S
35642:30	And so she 's going *-1 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try *-2 to make as much down payment as possible *-2 to keep the monthly payment low . E_S
35642:46	And so she 's going *-1 to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try *-2 to make as much down payment as possible *-2 to keep the monthly payment low . E_S
35870:23	so he had *-1 to do something *-1 to , put himself through school , E_S
35886:103	and \[ after , \+ after \] *-1 wasting the first six years , *-1 partying and everything else , I decided , uh-huh , time 0 * to settle down and do something *T*-2 . E_S
35921:146	I mean , I 've always felt that people on welfare should be required *-1 to spend \[ at least part of their time , \+ not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity * to look for a job , but at least some of their time \] \[ * to look for , \+ *-2 to go out \] and clean up the roads . You know , E_S
35945:7	get something out of that money . E_S
35987:7	and somebody 's taking that away . E_S
36032:51	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 there ought *-1 to be some kind of assistance as far as , uh , N_S
36033:26	and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance . E_S
36039:17	Educational or vocational training or something . E_S
36115:39	and \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] teach them something good . E_S
36136:25	I mean , I talked with somebody else about that another time , E_S
36166:21	I mean , that 's some- , N_S
36280:40	I think 0 youngsters ought *-1 to go out and do some public service , E_S
36290:62	\[ \[ They could , \+ they could , \] \+ I mean , you could \] organize something just within your community .
36305:129	I think 0 they ought *-1 to take them and , I do n't know , just have sort of like \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] manpower pool and say Okay , look , E_S we need somebody ... E_S
36325:14	* Play golf some , E_S
36344:13	It 's something 0 I can do *T*-1 with her , plus , um , does n't tax me too physically . E_S
36357:14	I do walk some too . E_S
36387:36	we 've , uh , just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment . E_S
36395:16	and I use that sometimes too . E_S
36523:17	At least it 's something 0 you enjoy *T*-1 . E_S
36532:7	And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like , Well I 've done a good job because I \[ got , \+ worked \] myself to that point . E_S
36566:33	and we were hoping , uh , *-1 to do some camping in the van , um , E_S
36577:17	um , up here some of the state parks are really nice E_S
36578:8	and some of them are n't *?* , E_S
36579:6	some of them are pretty rough . E_S
36587:8	but some of them are really nice E_S
36669:57	Other than , you know , * taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something \[ and , \+ and \] sweeping it out everyday , it *EXP*-1 's really hard * \[ to , \+ to \] keep the sand and dirt out of it . E_S
36703:9	just some of them are known E_S
36775:29	and I could really talk about like gardening or something , E_S
36884:17	I mean \[ some , \+ I think 0 some \] people that *T*-1 had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think 0 they stayed . E_S
36884:36	I mean \[ some , \+ I think 0 some \] people that *T*-1 had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think 0 they stayed . E_S

37026:84	What *T*-1 's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources 0 * to grow and produce their food *T*-2 , E_S but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way 0 it should *?* *T*-1 . E_S
37091:20	when you 've lost something \[ or , \+ or \] uh , uh , do n't have what other people have *T*-6 *T*-7 that 's when you tend *-4 to realize , you know , what *T*-1 's out there and \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you have *T*-3 and what you do n't have *T*-2 *T*-5 . E_S
37105:84	The only yes 0 I could go to *T*-1 is if uh , a renegade crew decides *-2 to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect \[ to , \+ to \] a nuclear exchange , E_S
37190:20	Uh , I think 0 sometimes other things suffer
37194:10	But in some ways I think 0 we are expected *-1 to do it all . E_S
37226:24	And if you do n't then , sometimes you feel like you 're looked down upon *-1 by people that *T*-2 go back to work and so you 're just wasting your time , at home . E_S
37233:25	I mean , I 've done some of both . E_S
37253:74	But , uh , even now , \[ I would , \+ I would \] like *-1 to not have *-2 to work in some ways . E_S
37319:46	\[ I , \+ well I \] see , I think 0 *T*-2 some people wanting *-1 to stay home more and take care of the children . E_S
37334:49	But , it would be nice if there could be an in-between , a middle ground somewhere . E_S
37401:112	\[ eve- , \+ every \] once in a while , I will keep \[ in , \+ in \] touch , with maybe , like who *T*-1 's in the top five of hitting , or something like that E_S
37402:44	but I do n't get into , you know , how many errors somebody has *T*-1 or things like that . E_S
37442:39	\[ and , \+ and , \] the , uh , statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three . E_S
37499:16	Now * having somebody get up and hit a solo home run \[ does you , \+ you know , gives you \] run , obviously . E_S
37503:55	But I mean if you ca n't do it with men on base , there 's something definitely wrong , um , you know , E_S
37565:30	Do you still keep up with them , or someth- , E_S
37585:99	it seems that what you really need *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to win though , is * to have a team that *T*-4 has reasonable talent and has some people that *T*-5 \[ \[ have , \+ have , \] \+ have \] real breakthrough years . E_S
37686:88	* say 0 you go to a rock concert , \[ or , \+ or \] even a performance , \[ a , \+ an \] opera or the symphony or something , uh , E_S
37706:20	but \[ what , \+ somehow \] or another they , attract , uh , so many people from , \[ som- , \+ \] N_S
37736:14	'cause I did some teaching part-time E_S
37766:94	what *T*-1 gets me is 0 I ca n't believe that \[ Congress , \+ uh , or , our state legislature \] ca n't come up with , uh , some kind of workable means 0 * to have funds for the school *T*-2 . E_S
37799:27	or they going *-1 be taught *-2 something , E_S
37814:65	Not if you can read or write , \[ or do , \+ or \[ un- , \+ understand \] \] some science . N_S
37967:58	Of course , \[ wh- , \+ if \] I say 0 this is a good value , someone else is going *-1 to stand up and say , oh no . E_S
38022:14	and I process some ratings and \[ put , \+ do \] graphics for their television stations , MUMBLEx their clients , E_S
38030:48	It 's basically just data entry and * running , you know , \[ some , \+ some \] software E_S
38030:56	It 's basically just data entry and * running , you know , \[ some , \+ some \] software E_S
38068:7	but sometimes MUMBLEx \[ my husband , \+ my husband \] says usually , I work on the computer all day at work , E_S
38073:11	Um , something with the defense . E_S
38082:5	something like that , E_S
38167:5	sometimes \[ he bri- , \+ he brought \] home \[ a , \+ uh , a \] portable one , E_S
38259:23	when they start *-1 needing something *T*-2 , you know , then that will be different E_S
38275:22	I had *-1 to do some of my husband 's papers because I had access to one E_S
38311:21	You probably use MUMBLEx or something like that , for your , uh , data entry stuff that you 're , talking about *T*-1 . E_S
38337:27	I just do , you know , something really minor E_S
38338:16	but , it 's something that nobody else wants *-1 to do *T*-2 , E_S
38356:24	you know , it 's not something that *T*-1 's continual because , you know , the television ratings do n't come out , you know , all the time . E_S
38368:32	and , people always asking me *-1 to do something else . E_S
38377:55	and I 've got lots of documentation 0 I need *-1 to review *T*-2 and some 0 I need *-3 to revise *T*-4 . E_S
38454:28	It *EXP*-1 's hard * to *?* sometimes . E_S
38537:26	Maybe in the mall family book store , something like that . E_S
38546:39	but that has a little bit 0 *T*-1 to do with some of the things that I read *T*-2 . E_S
38557:11	Right now some of the things 0 I 'm working with *T*-1 are kids that *T*-2 are dealing with sexual abuse , E_S
38568:10	Well , sometimes it 's rewarding , E_S
38569:21	\[ and , \+ and \] sometimes it 's a struggle . E_S
38606:37	I 've always wanted *-1 to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um , because I enjoyed some of those stories so much , E_S
38606:73	I 've always wanted *-1 to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um , because I enjoyed some of those stories so much , E_S
38616:30	Um , I trying *-1 to think of some of my other favorite books , E_S
38651:18	Someone just recently said something really neat about that . E_S
38757:28	It 's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that . E_S
38808:24	I \[ do \+ do \] some crafts like it mentioned in the thing , E_S
38813:27	I was trying *-1 to think of some \[ while , \+ while \] it was , uh , talking about it , E_S
38815:24	it *EXP*-1 took so long for someone to answer , E_S
38831:43	so I could n't really leave it out if I was working on something . E_S
38843:26	I get too involved in reading *ICH*-2 sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing *T*-1 . E_S
38863:14	and I did some of that .
38884:41	\[ I 've , \+ I 've , \] uh , made some small things , cross stitch things . E_S
38891:63	It 's just been so long since I 've actually sat down and taken the time *-1 to do something like that . E_S
38892:19	But I have recently done some cross stitch . E_S
38901:14	I 've done some \[ cross , \+ um , cross \] stitch , E_S
38903:70	and I always have *-1 to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered \[ or , \+ or \] something . E_S
38912:34	\[ I was , \+ I was \] making some little things for Christmas , E_S
38943:28	and I thought I better *T*-1 do some simple things and work up to this because it *EXP*-3 was just so difficult * to get it done *-2 . E_S
38956:17	And I 've done some of the crewel and \[ the , \+ \] um something similar to that E_S
38956:50	And I 've done some of the crewel and \[ the , \+ \] um something similar to that E_S
38966:14	More like embroidery or something . N_S
38990:62	and whenever I go *-1 visit my parents *T*-2 , they 're always saying , Well , * bring some of your tapes . E_S
39000:22	and they said , * Bring some tapes with you . E_S
39014:24	in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there , E_S
39015:38	and then in the summer I 'll plant petunias , E_S or something that *T*-1 's colorful E_S
39023:24	I probably should go *-1 buy some . E_S
39027:44	I guess 0 if I had a house I might enjoy gardening , some . E_S
39048:41	You know , I feel like , Oh , I 've accomplished something . E_S
39095:57	So . I think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be nice * to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch . E_S
39102:59	So , um , I think 0 if I just would be , N_S if I 'd do something , be motivated enough *-1 to do something , I think it would work out well . E_S
39102:82	So , um , I think 0 if I just would be , N_S if I 'd do something , be motivated enough *-1 to do something , I think it would work out well . E_S
39155:39	I 'd love *-1 to \[ have , \+ have \] some animals . E_S
39179:80	if we were going *-1 to get anything now it would definitely be a cat , or even a bird or a fish tank or \[ something , \+ you know . Something \] small E_S
39190:79	because , you kind of , N_S \[ even , \+ even \] a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *T*-1 . E_S
39202:53	And if I was a cat or dog , I 'd respond probably by *-1 biting or something . E_S
39241:51	\[ It , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] kind of hard * to find time sometimes E_S
39356:63	Well , \[ I just , \+ I just \] do n't think 0 you can go wrong with something like that . E_S
39372:27	and then I mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi- , and some cool whip , E_S
39372:59	and then I mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta wi- , and some cool whip , E_S
39446:18	We 've been fixing something *ICH*-1 lately that ,
39475:18	and \[ that 's some- , \+ that 's something \] that just , you know , \[ it *EXP*-1 \+ \] does n't take a long time * to fix *T*-2 , E_S
39475:33	and \[ that 's some- , \+ that 's something \] that just , you know , \[ it *EXP*-1 \+ \] does n't take a long time * to fix *T*-2 , E_S
39486:15	and there are sometimes 0 you just do n't feel like *-2 eating out *T*-1 , E_S
39490:25	and I wish 0 I had something a little bit different , to just zap together . E_S
39499:32	* mix up a little , uh , mayonnaise with some dijon mustard , and honey until it just , N_S
39557:35	I think 0 we 'll try *-1 to do something a little bit , N_S
39558:60	we might try *-1 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ um , to \] grill some flounder or salmon steaks . E_S
39587:11	and \[ some , \+ a lot of \] times they 'll give us something . E_S
39587:46	and \[ some , \+ a lot of \] times they 'll give us something . E_S
39592:38	Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips , just over it , and some red onion slices , and just a little bit of , um , basil , and then a little Italian dressing over it . E_S
39620:16	And you can put some cucumber slices on too . E_S
39679:13	I stir fried some the other night though . E_S
39720:20	Cause , we have \[ some , \+ some \] local ones . E_S
39720:28	Cause , we have \[ some , \+ some \] local ones . E_S
39952:53	\[ They did n't have , \+ they did n't have \] *-1 to go through some tough games during the year E_S
40148:42	but \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 the headlines said something about him , you know , that the Mavericks released him or something , E_S
40148:81	but \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 the headlines said something about him , you know , that the Mavericks released him or something , E_S
40207:77	but I mean 0 there 's two guys named * Johnson *ICH*-1 on their team that *T*-2 are really good or doing good or something , E_S
40340:38	and I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less . E_S
40503:27	Did you have them in a center or something last summer ? E_S
40513:36	and there we had , uh , I do n't know some , N_S
40575:47	there 's an association *ICH*-1 here in town of professional home , care providers or something like that . E_S
40601:76	she gets home visitations by the \[ s- , \+ \] MUMBLEx I do n't know , the state boards , I guess , some of them and then some by the association , E_S
40601:91	she gets home visitations by the \[ s- , \+ \] MUMBLEx I do n't know , the state boards , I guess , some of them and then some by the association , E_S
40661:62	\[ and \+ \] he just really missed *-1 being able *-2 to be by himself , and having some peace and quiet E_S
40672:26	we all need that time , just some quiet time 0 *-1 to wind down from the day *T*-2 . E_S
40761:23	and he like comes home with something new everyday , you know E_S
40815:12	She knows something right , that she MUMBLEx N_S
40864:17	\[ Some , \+ sometimes \] that 's fine , E_S
40868:10	but then sometimes , you know , N_S
40919:8	and some of those other places I would n't have *?* . E_S
40964:52	And , then what they did *T*-1 was they asked every family *-4 to write something about their family . \[ And , \+ \] like , how many kids you had *T*-2 , and who you had married *T*-3 , E_S
41201:12	a house or something . E_S
41213:86	See , that would be great because then you could spend so much more time *ICH*-1 together , than if you all were in your own hotels or something . E_S
41220:49	And then , every time 0 you wanted *-1 to go *-2 eat with somebody *T*-3 , you 'd probably have *-4 to go to out , *-5 eat or something . E_S
41220:96	And then , every time 0 you wanted *-1 to go *-2 eat with somebody *T*-3 , you 'd probably have *-4 to go to out , *-5 eat or something . E_S
41238:68	* Ask them what they have *T*-1 , you know , at area lakes and all . If they have something like that E_S
41288:91	But , \[ that 's , \+ uh , you know , that 's \] the best way 0 I found *T*-1 , because whenever you have , something where you go and , N_S
41308:127	But , I did n't think 0 that was as good . Because , it was like , you know , you could n't really talk and stuff , like you could *?* when , you were at the lake , or somewhere , you know , where you were out . E_S
41356:63	I think 0 there was four or five different people , that *T*-1 would call , you know , some of them , if they did n't have their addresses and all on them , E_S
41394:27	Now if there was a sickness or something like that , I mean , you know , you 're not going *-1 to lose that many . E_S
41458:24	like if I did n't want somebody to come , then I just would n't send them one of the questionnaires . E_S
41495:41	it has everybody that you could ever imagine *T*-1 , and some 0 you could n't *?* *T*-2 . E_S
41505:19	and , it will be something 0 my kids will have *T*-1 , you know . E_S
41534:24	I just remember 0 they had some funny stories , E_S
41537:77	Maybe what you could do *T*-1 if you could n't get into a full family reunion , and you wanted *-2 to go back some , N_S
41541:27	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents *T*-1 , then \[ you can find out from , \+ you know , you can find somebody \] else that *T*-2 can tell you something else about these , E_S
41541:97	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents *T*-1 , then \[ you can find out from , \+ you know , you can find somebody \] else that *T*-2 can tell you something else about these , E_S
41541:124	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents *T*-1 , then \[ you can find out from , \+ you know , you can find somebody \] else that *T*-2 can tell you something else about these , E_S
41620:12	but , for some reason a mini skirt is , to me a little more unprofessional 0 * to wear *T*-1 to work than jeans E_S
41643:12	There are some that *T*-1 are really short E_S
41644:17	and then there are some that *T*-1 may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee . E_S
41685:67	Well I feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there 's men around and some of the managers are men *T*-1 , \[ you just , \+ you know , you \] do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily . E_S
41724:32	Even with the very tailored look of a suit , sometimes I like *-1 to have \[ someth- , \+ \[ a lit- , \+ just a little \] something \] that *T*-2 's feminine . E_S
41724:55	Even with the very tailored look of a suit , sometimes I like *-1 to have \[ someth- , \+ \[ a lit- , \+ just a little \] something \] that *T*-2 's feminine . E_S

41767:21	but when I go out somewhere *T*-1 , then , uh , unless I have a pair of dress slacks , I do n't usually wear a lot of blue jeans . E_S
41814:7	and sometimes I think 0 you may be more productive if you 're comfortable with what you 're wearing *T*-1 and can \[ \[ be , \+ be , \] \+ feel \] more relaxed .
41815:15	Whereas , uh , sometimes when you 're in the suit and feel , kind of almost stiff and \[ you 're not , \+ you know , maybe you \[ do n't , \+ uh , ca n't \] \] get as comfortable *-2 to sit down *T*-1 E_S
41881:82	and I believe also in \[ shooting of , uh , rape , \+ I mean * killing a rape \] victim . I mean someone in the process of rape , E_S
41910:50	but I think 0 if they 're going *-1 to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it . E_S
41919:16	Uh , I heard something on the news the other night
41993:53	and then quite often they 'll get shot *-1 , because they 're horning in on somebody else 's territory . E_S
42099:19	the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas , you know . E_S
42116:7	some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do *T*-1 , \[ it 's just , \+ it just \] gets out of hand , E_S
42150:39	Uh , I ca n't remember what the town was *T*-1 , some little area . E_S

44367:22	I think 0 it has something 0 *T*-1 to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic , uh , country , E_S
44431:21	You know , uh , something 0 we compete with *T*-1 . E_S

44591:18	it *EXP*-2 frustrates me sometimes * not being able *-1 to have a dog E_S
44674:38	Uh , \[ and , \+ and , \] you know , some people might not believe that E_S
44680:131	Like \[ if I , \+ if I \] put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours , uh , because I was going out .

44689:89	the first thing 0 you do *T*-1 is you get up and \[ \[ you , \+ you , \] \+ you \] feed this cat \[ some- , \+ something \] \[ and , \+ and \] you make * sure that it can get to its litter box . E_S

44690:13	Well , for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through E_S
44721:43	Well , she ended *-1 staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care . E_S
44743:75	Well , \[ the , \+ see the \] problem is 0 \[ \[ if , \+ if the , \] \+ if someone \] would have came up to me and said it 's going *-1 to cost you five hundred dollars *-2 to keep your dog alive . E_S What do you want *-1 to do *T*-2 ? E_S I probably would have had second thoughts . E_S
44801:97	because they 're both \[ in their , \+ in their \] seventies . And , uh , the cat , uh , although it 's a little bit of work for them sometimes , \[ it turns , \+ it turns \] out *-1 to be , uh , uh , a pleasant experience for them . E_S
44824:20	Maybe we 'll talk again sometimes . E_S
44845:21	I think 0 it 's somewhere really close to that cause I think 0 a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going *-1 to make that much difference . E_S
44857:208	And I think 0 one of the good ways of * solving that is \[ to \+ like , everybody likes *-1 to come to \] a party so * have a voting party \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go *-2 vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something . E_S
44885:39	And \[ ma- , \+ maybe \] * let them have some mock , I mean uh , you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start *-1 really young . E_S
44922:19	and people are finally taking some action against it . E_S
44935:38	I mean , I 'm sure 0 you heard about some of ours . E_S
44944:48	And that 's the reason 0 I said 0 maybe if you had something like a block party *T*-1 . E_S
44954:22	like , maybe they could give something
44955:53	like , uh , the top neighborhood , if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that , you know . E_S
45020:14	and you have some success and want *-1 to go on *-2 learning and continue *-2 learning , uh and not wait until they 're in high school E_S
45052:41	And , okay , \[ this , \+ this \] candidate tells you some things that *T*-1 are going *-2 to happen E_S
45056:18	and this candidate tells you some things . E_S
45065:16	If they did something like that and started kids out *-3 real young and showed them , okay now you 're not going *-1 to get *-2 to vote E_S
45078:82	They would put them *-4 to realize \[ that , \+ that \] they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what someone else says *T*-5 even though they did n't vote for it . And that maybe they need *-3 to think twice about *-6 voting . E_S
45082:8	Now some people object during primaries , *-1 having *-2 to declare a party , whether Republican or Democrat E_S
45093:89	If they really wanted *-1 to vote Republican , they could go in the primary and say 0 they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat *T*-2 . E_S
45095:206	and , uh , I do think 0 more needs *-2 to be done *-3 along that line * to help * to , uh , teach the \[ people , \+ uh , uh , everyone , \] uh , more about what *T*-1 is going on with voting and with nonvoting . So that , uh , \[ we can make , \+ they 're making \] some more intelligent decisions . E_S
45129:113	And \[ it took me , \+ I mean it *EXP*-3 took \] such courage 0 you would n't believe *T*-1 * to go *-4 vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I did n't know how * to work the machines *T*-2 . E_S
45148:52	Where \[ if they 'd , \+ if they 'd \] had a class or something or just \[ to \+ a short time , you know , * to , \] said okay , this is the way , N_S
45157:30	I \[ s- , \+ \] asked him something about well \[ did you , \+ who did you \] vote \[ for *T*-1 , \+ for , \] uh , cheerleader ? E_S
45381:15	I mean , some maybe N_S
45474:37	like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something . E_S
45535:52	and now , it *EXP*-3 's like a major production , * trying *-2 to find somebody 0 *T*-1 to take care of the dog while you 're gone . E_S
45630:75	If you do not pick the trash *ICH*-1 up , you know , the container , and put it on a table or chair or something , she 'll knock it over , E_S
45703:26	And I want *-1 to tell you something . E_S
45707:24	They 're going *-1 to go somewhere pretty shortly . E_S
45774:33	Now , they 've been able *-1 to get some good players and come around E_S
45927:70	But , I mean , I do n't know whether they have one of the first , you know , choices of somebody , E_S
45967:14	Because we had some , E_S
45981:28	Or either they 'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies . E_S
46041:14	this is just something on the side E_S
46121:25	if you get *-1 to watch some of these , N_S
46188:38	Oh , and \[ it was , \+ it was \] something else . E_S
46234:17	\[ Some , \+ some \] places do have guard gates that you have *-1 to get through *T*-2 , or electronic access gates and things like that .
46308:37	They 're just getting , uh , put *-1 on probation or something , because the prisons do n't have enough room E_S
46314:8	and some of those people , they do n't deserve *-1 to be let *-2 loose . E_S
46327:16	And , uh , someone who *T*-1 was in the neighborhood *-2 cleaning carpets , these two men , went in , raped the girl , murdered her , and the whole bit . E_S
46356:49	the reasons that they 're doing it *T*-1 compared to the reason 0 someone else is in jail for it *T*-2 , you know , it 's like two different things . E_S
46360:20	Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love *T*-1 *T*-2 , you do some crazy things E_S
46360:51	Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love *T*-1 *T*-2 , you do some crazy things E_S
46367:46	\[ I , \+ I \] like the idea that , uh , if someone is from a foreign country , and they come to this country and uh , commit , a crime , I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything , they should be immediately deported *-1 . E_S
46428:48	I went to the Far East , uh , back in October *-1 to do some training for T I E_S
46433:11	uh , some of those countries were so safe , 0 it was unreal . E_S
46452:7	and somebody will turn it in E_S
46471:34	But I was thinking boy , in Dallas , if somebody asked me if there were places 0 you would n't go *T*-1 by yourself at night , I 'd have *-2 to set them down for about five or ten minutes *-2 to list all the places out . E_S
46540:118	This plea bargaining baloney , where , uh , you know , they plead to a lesser crime , or , uh , they plead *-1 guilty \[ in , \+ \] or , you know , tell about someone else and \[ they , \+ they \] get less time *T*-2 , N_S
46570:21	You have *-1 to start somewhere . E_S
46596:16	and especially not in some of these big cities , E_S
46615:18	Because they 'll arrest someone and , you know , go through all that paperwork and * writing a report and all this , and * having all kinds of evidence E_S
46718:36	Well , maybe you need *-1 to unload it on somebody el- , . E_S
46775:5	something like that , E_S
46803:40	and , uh , you know , I always been looking for something sporty E_S
46804:39	and I ended up *-2 getting , you know , basically something that I could , you know , afford *T*-1 . E_S
46824:33	but I 'm definitely going *-1 to look for something , uh , in the , you know , nice , perpor- , you know , N_S
46839:12	There 's some kind of problems . E_S

46902:17	I think , 0 something 's wrong with this . E_S
46951:17	but supposedly they have some real wood built * in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel , E_S
46964:90	\[ If it 's a limited edition usually , \+ no matter what it is *T*-1 , if it 's a limited edition , it 's usually \] worth something later on . E_S

48924:29	\[ and , \+ but \] still , for some reason , you know , \[ this , \+ this \] guy 's sentence has not been carried *-1 out , you know , E_S

49056:12	There are some smaller , E_S
49151:24	They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy , E_S
49175:55	uh , reasonable construction would probably run you , uh , right now \[ anywhere between , \+ somewhere between \] a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars .
49261:74	And they bought their home in \[ I , \+ I \] want *-1 to say like *RNR*-2 around nineteen seventy-five or something like that , E_S

49312:30	it 's not unusual , for example , for somewhere around here

49591:83	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] was thinking about *-1 buying a Prelude from a friend who *T*-2 was moving to New York or something E_S

50153:223	And , uh , \[ I just , \+ I \] heard a comment *ICH*-3 on the radio this morning that , uh , you know , \[ it , \+ it \] gets to a point where , uh , if enough people \[ are , \+ are \] going *-1 to be slaughtered *-2 over there over \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] internal problems , um , somebody may step in again *T*-4 .

50231:57	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] I do n't have any doubt that through some back channels \[ that \+ \] we encouraged it . You know . E_S

50704:33	It *EXP*-3 would be great * to have some of those organizations like 0 you mentioned *T*-1 that *T*-2 were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids . E_S

50752:165	Well , I think that \[ in the , \+ in the \] cases \[ that , \+ like that , \] uh , they had *-1 to be , uh , pretty thoroughly examined *-2 *-1 to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth , and that this was n't something new 0 *T*-3 just to keep out of * going to war . E_S
50756:19	It was , uh , something that *T*-1 was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life . E_S

50845:44	Um , well , like I say , I know that there are some type of programs that they have *T*-1 available for \[ a youth , \+ like teenagers \] to go and do , um , work in the national parks and work in , uh , neighborhoods *-2 to \[ do , \+ \] um , clean up and that sort of thing . E_S

50920:26	What *T*-1 was the reason why somebody was trying *-2 to find out all that stuff *T*-3 ? E_S
50948:85	Something that I feel 0 *T*-1 \[ is a , \+ is \[ a , \+ \] \] pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-2 's really so common that it 's accepted *-3 as the norm now , is \[ the op- , \+ the open \] office concept . E_S

53930:7	but somewhere \[ in , \+ \] you 've got *-1 to find an even line . E_S

53979:26	It 's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend . E_S
54010:82	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 mostly as far \[ as , \+ as \] crafts go , I 've done , um , some needlepoint . E_S

55034:11	uh , some of them did n't E_S
55084:23	In a way Aikman has done some of that . E_S

55165:39	Uh , Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes , because of some of the stupid stuff 0 he does *T*-1 , E_S
55168:5	sometimes it 's too good because he throws too hard . E_S
55224:111	And my reasons are based *-1 upon not only \[ from \+ \] \[ what I read *T*-2 in the newspapers , \+ what I see *T*-3 on the newspapers , \] but up against some of the , fun and exciting things 0 I ran into *T*-4 during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group . E_S
55281:86	I guess 0 that 's what *T*-1 concerns me the most . Is 0 \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] so unstable that somebody like that could make , uh , decisions that *T*-2 would jeopardize a lot of people . E_S
55289:86	There 's probably five or six , which *T*-1 would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs , that *T*-2 are in positions over some of these Soviet states . E_S
55316:28	But on a highly populated area , like some of the Soviet cities would be *?* , with the weaponry that *T*-1 's attached *-2 on those things , there is no place 0 * to hide *T*-3 . E_S
55334:34	But , during that same time frame , did n't you get some feeling , that , I mean , they 're getting all these weapons and stuff ? E_S

55382:39	I guess 0 I 'd would like *-1 to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power . E_S
55391:26	and he 's had his problems with some of the old guard himself . E_S
55413:38	But you still better have the key players in place , if something does go down . Even if it 's a regional conflict . E_S
55603:52	but \[ \[ i- , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] at least something . E_S
55853:56	because it \[ was , \+ you know , took \] a couple tries before I found somebody . E_S

55906:154	Things that *T*-1 need *-2 to be done *-3 , \[ that *T*-4 wou- , \+ that *T*-5 could \] be done *-6 in an hour or two , uh , a day , or several hours of the week . Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that . In addition to what one does *T*-7 , uh , besides that . E_S
55924:11	it gave some folks some jobs , E_S

55925:13	and we got some great public works out of it . E_S
55938:34	And this would give them a chance *-1 to have some positive self-esteem . E_S
55947:96	and also , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] feel more like , you know , you 're actually part of the community if you 've done something , in it . E_S

55968:44	\[ It 's , \+ it almost needs \] *-1 to be something that *T*-2 has more impact for the individual , on going . E_S

56059:56	and I thought 0 I had seen , when we were traveling around the state *T*-1 , some similar signs *ICH*-2 up that *T*-3 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up *-4 E_S

56112:54	\[ It , \+ it \] makes me feel like , well , there may be something left for my children , my nieces and nephews and so forth . E_S

56204:26	and you put a bay leaf and put some , uh , red pepper over it . E_S

56274:79	\[ And \+ \] in \[ a \+ like a , \] oh , what do you call it *T*-1 ? Like Pyrex or something like that , kind of bowl that *T*-2 would go in the microwave . E_S

62597:189	\[ \[ \[ I think \[ just , \+ uh , just , \] uh , one of the \[ maj- , \+ major , \] \+ I think 0 it was a , \] \+ you know , I do n't , \] \+ I think \] 0 it was , uh , you know , like a Highlands or something like this . E_S
62613:21	I think 0 they deliberately sometimes , um , N_S
62657:57	The fact \[ that they , \+ that they \] have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes , uh , dwells on a fact that , you know , uh , N_S
62849:29	and then I was having *-1 to work some real late hours *-1 to get caught with my work after I got out of class . E_S
62853:41	And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week *-1 to do some training at the T I up there . E_S
62885:8	and some of them require me to go out of town , E_S
62922:28	that makes a difference when you have somebody 0 * to go with *T*-1 and 0 *T*-2 to do the same the same thing *T*-3 . E_S
62928:15	I mean , some I , N_S
62976:42	Like when I walk *T*-1 I 'll take along a radio or something E_S
62998:35	Um , E_S it 's a lot more fun than some other things 0 I could do *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
63067:68	So , you know , \[ you , not only , \+ you know , you 're not only \] doing something *-1 to keep yourself fit , but you 're probably prolonging your life . E_S
63128:13	Of course , sometimes you do n't like *-1 to see the mirrors on the wall E_S
63132:21	But , I guess , 0 sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going . E_S
63145:47	I think 0 if I had *-1 to come home and then go somewhere , I 'd never make it . E_S
63163:19	Uh , E_S they have some \[ during , \+ during \] lunch hour that *T*-1 are shorter , E_S
63174:15	they even have some late night ones for people that *T*-1 work second shift and things like that . E_S
63176:14	They even have some , uh , \[ aerobic , \+ uh , water aerobics \] when the weather gets nice *T*-1 out in the pool . E_S
63193:46	and I think 0 they 're working on *-1 building a jogging track and some other things . E_S
63260:17	and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter . E_S
63286:100	I kind of remember 0 back when gas prices started up , you know , pretty dramatically *T*-1 when they started *-3 getting toward a dollar a gallon range *T*-2 , E_S somebody had , uh , E_S
63319:95	I would expect people with any kind of buying power \[ over the age , \+ you know , under the age \] of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is *T*-1 , anyway . E_S
63332:29	but , you know , it 's like somebody said , okay as of such and such a date , you know , anybody caught * talking in the English , you know , will be shot *-1 or something like that , you know . E_S
63332:120	but , you know , it 's like somebody said , okay as of such and such a date , you know , anybody caught * talking in the English , you know , will be shot *-1 or something like that , you know . E_S
63382:11	And then some of them are done *-1 in , you know , purely metric . E_S
63391:5	somewhere down the line they went standardized , E_S
63418:31	You know , I guess 0 that 's some N_S
63423:28	it 's like a half a liter or something like that . E_S
63462:5	something like that . E_S
63481:24	now , okay , we run into some problems once , E_S
63499:27	but Nash , essentially , in the U S somewhere . N_S
63581:7	and some are in kilometers . E_S
63593:18	and they 've got some great big bins there for newspaper , um , plastic , um , I think three bins for glass , white , green , and \[ whatev- , \+ whatever \] other combination there is *T*-1 . E_S
63596:63	\[ And , \+ and \] I think 0 they 've got \[ a comp- , \+ \] uh , some kind of container for aluminum . E_S
63628:168	Well , Rowlett had \[ sent , \+ sent \] out a survey *ICH*-4 , not too long ago , um , in terms in how many people *T*-1 were interested in *-2 having \[ a , \+ a \] pick up , I guess , on the days 0 they do trash *T*-3 or something like that . E_S
63631:52	but \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] supposed *-1 to initiate that \[ some- , \+ sometime \] in the next couple of months . E_S
63631:60	but \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] supposed *-1 to initiate that \[ some- , \+ sometime \] in the next couple of months . E_S
63690:51	And I think 0 they 're trying *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] make some changes . E_S
63691:37	\[ I , \+ I \] noticed at the library or someplace this past , uh , month , month and a half ago , 0 they were having a speaker , um , talk about * doing lawn work and , \[ h- , \+ how \] important it *EXP*-1 is *T*-2 * \[ to , \+ to \] cut your lawn without a bag .

63739:65	uh , one of the questions was , do you think 0 more *ICH*-2 should be done *-1 , or something else . E_S
63740:30	\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S
63740:81	\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S
63760:41	but the cost \[ is , \+ is \] like , double or sometimes triple , \[ what \+ \] the regular \[ things 0 you , \+ fertilizers and things 0 you \] buy *T*-1 . E_S
63769:74	companies that *T*-1 do at least go into it , E_S I 'd like *-1 to see subsidy by the government or something , or tax-wise or something , heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular *T*-2 . E_S

63788:33	And if we 're going *-1 to really do something , they ought *-3 to put that stuff out *-2 bigger for people to see it . E_S
63797:36	You have *-1 to get enough nerve * to ask somebody *-2 to take something off the top shelf . E_S
63797:49	You have *-1 to get enough nerve * to ask somebody *-2 to take something off the top shelf . E_S
63801:30	\[ I , \+ I 'd \] heard something stranger , E_S
63841:6	something else was made *-1 out of old tires , E_S
63915:17	At least we found something different . E_S
63924:14	I usually get some place , N_S
64077:19	The other day we had some hail , the biggest hail 0 I 've ever seen *T*-1 in Texas . E_S
64142:32	My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs , said something to the effect of , now 0 we 've made the national news , * do n't get upset , and do n't worry , E_S
64207:53	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] they 're supposed *-1 to be building a mall somewhere close \[ \[ by , \+ by the next , \] \+ by \] ninety-three or ninety-four or something , E_S

64249:28	But if I were *-1 to live some place else , it certainly meets my standards . E_S
64345:11	they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles .
64391:18	And they 've built some new highways out to that area , and things , lately . E_S
64421:19	Oh , it 's green sometime . E_S
64511:14	but , um , sometimes I have a hard time *-1 \[ unders- , \+ you know , hearing \] the words clearly if I 'm in the car and there 's noise and stuff E_S
64738:53	But \[ if you do , \+ if you do \] have *-1 to go something , I guess 0 we can just cut off . E_S
64749:24	and I hope 0 you get some more calls and make some more calls . E_S
64749:36	and I hope 0 you get some more calls and make some more calls . E_S
65044:48	And I \[ hope 0 we , \+ hope 0 we \] did them some good , uh , on their little computer dealy . E_S
65139:41	And it was like , uh , I want *-1 to read something else for a while . E_S
65143:6	some of those books are real tough 0 * to get into *T*-1 , E_S
65161:45	but \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] hard sometimes . E_S
65209:23	Is n't it *EXP*-1 amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction ? E_S
65240:13	does he get some royalties from that , hopefully ? E_S
65251:7	But sometimes the more 0 you get *T*-2 the more you want *T*-1 too , E_S
65434:30	And , uh , we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets , you know , box seats or something ,
65434:63	And , uh , we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets , you know , box seats or something ,
65456:19	It 's , uh , something 0 we 're really irritated about *T*-1 around here . E_S Or some people are really irritated about *T*-1 . E_S
65456:58	It 's , uh , something 0 we 're really irritated about *T*-1 around here . E_S Or some people are really irritated about *T*-1 . E_S
65610:24	It was like John Feinstein or something like that 0 *T*-1 wrote it . E_S
65618:24	Uh , I was listening to something on the radio about , uh , you know , a talk show about sports books , E_S
65686:11	Uh , someone gets picked *-1 up for drunk driving , E_S he should put enough *ICH*-2 in there that *T*-1 goes back into *-3 paying for that policeman being out there . E_S
65696:29	But again I 'd like *-1 to see something on the other end back into education . But not in the education 0 we have *T*-2 today . E_S
65698:44	I would like *-1 to be a little more into * investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems . And * to come up with something a little better than what we 've got *T*-2 . E_S
65698:97	I would like *-1 to be a little more into * investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems . And * to come up with something a little better than what we 've got *T*-2 . E_S
65704:30	But , uh , I was just talking to somebody else , E_S
65715:56	But I 'm just saying that even the differences , uh , is that , you know , some countries pay for students to go \[ to , \+ through \] college and etcetera . E_S
65738:134	I think 0 \[ the pro- , \+ you know , that 's \] one reason , 0 uh , you know , we do have the education *T*-1 is that what it *EXP*-3 takes *T*-2 for these companies to bring somebody on board .
65746:21	But they ca n't just bring somebody in without *-1 even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . E_S
65757:22	You know , they want somebody *ICH*-3 , you know , \[ when they then , \+ when they \] \[ bring them off , \+ bring them in *T*-1 , \] that *T*-2 they have something , you know , a certain amount 0 * to contribute *T*-4 . E_S
65757:122	You know , they want somebody *ICH*-3 , you know , \[ when they then , \+ when they \] \[ bring them off , \+ bring them in *T*-1 , \] that *T*-2 they have something , you know , a certain amount 0 * to contribute *T*-4 . E_S
65776:49	and all of a sudden we had a bad , uh , frequency *ICH*-1 there or something . E_S
65777:13	So we had some interference , E_S
65781:35	It sounded 0 you were calling from around the world somewhere . E_S
65787:129	but , uh , you know , I think , 0 uh , \[ they , \+ maybe they \] need *-2 to , uh , help *-3 promote that more . Give incentives like , uh , if they do bring somebody on , they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is *T*-1 , you know , for them to train people , you know , stuff like that .
65787:148	but , uh , you know , I think , 0 uh , \[ they , \+ maybe they \] need *-2 to , uh , help *-3 promote that more . Give incentives like , uh , if they do bring somebody on , they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is *T*-1 , you know , for them to train people , you know , stuff like that .
65794:18	Well , that 's something about what Germany 's supposed *-1 to be doing *T*-2 . Something similar to that right now . E_S
65796:26	But see , that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people . \[ At people , per , \+ at high school level , \] which I would like *-1 to see *T*-2 . Rather than so many kids getting out of school . E_S
65810:26	I think , 0 I just heard something the other day , E_S
65833:63	Where if they 're said *-5 , hey , it *EXP*-7 's just as advisable * to go into something 0 you enjoy *T*-6 and you like *T*-6 . N_S
65921:58	\[ I , \+ uh , I 'm \] trying my best right now *-1 to pay off some of mine . E_S
65926:36	\[ And , \+ uh , but \] still I have some that *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] up to the limit . E_S
65956:15	You know , sometimes you have *-1 to ask them for that . E_S
65987:58	I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] tempting when you see something *T*-1 * to say , `` Well , I 'll just charge it . '' E_S
65988:7	And sometimes I 'll do that , E_S
66002:55	Because we never know when we might , you know , get laid *-3 off or something *T*-4 . E_S
66022:28	I know 0 they 're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs . E_S
66052:17	\[ Something , \+ something \] happens , E_S
66107:12	That 's something 0 I never thought about *-4 getting , you know , checking with *T*-2 *-3 to see \[ what , \+ what \] your credit report looked like *T*-1 . E_S
66118:21	You might even find 0 somebody 's been reporting on you E_S
66120:60	You know , \[ you , \+ I mean you \] might think 0 you 're paying something on time E_S
66124:40	If you 've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that . E_S
66129:9	Or something 0 you have n't paid *T*-1 in sixty days or ninety days , you know . And things like that . N_S
66258:94	I saw a statistic *ICH*-2 just a few days ago , um , 0 so far this \[ ye- , \+ year , \] or was it during the last year , \[ somewh- , \+ during \] a year 's time , I think 0 it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation . E_S
66268:27	what *T*-1 's amazing is 0 some of them have been on death row for a number of years . E_S
66315:17	I do n't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they 're afraid 0 they 're going *-1 to get sentenced *-2 to death . E_S
66360:47	I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that , I mean pretty soon you run out of people 0 * to murder *T*-1 . E_S
66485:14	you know some people on the case \[ were , \+ were \] a little hesitant on * convicting him on some of the charges E_S
66485:70	you know some people on the case \[ were , \+ were \] a little hesitant on * convicting him on some of the charges E_S
66510:63	I think , uh , 0 now if you 're dealing drugs now , caught more than twice or something , uh , \[ it , \+ \] there 's , uh , a death penalty associated * with it . E_S
66522:34	but \[ it , \+ it 's \] not worth somebody getting executed *-1 for *?* . E_S
66523:72	But we hear so much about the violence and how it *EXP*-1 's not safe * to walk the streets because \[ somebody , \+ \] you know , these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing . E_S
66529:89	you , never know when they 're going *-1 to turn or hurt the next person *T*-2 because it *EXP*-3 does n't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt *-4 or not . E_S
66542:15	there are \[ some , \+ some \] other crimes that I think , uh , you know , uh , N_S
66542:24	there are \[ some , \+ some \] other crimes that I think , uh , you know , uh , N_S
66548:15	but , um , some of these people are just out and out brutal . E_S
66550:6	some of the cases 0 I 've heard about *T*-1 over the years , N_S
66578:34	\[ It 's , \+ there 's \] always something 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S
66611:13	or I did something . E_S
66801:15	And \[ \[ some , \+ some \] of the people , \+ uh , some of \] the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too , are picking up some of those great big houses , E_S
66801:24	And \[ \[ some , \+ some \] of the people , \+ uh , some of \] the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too , are picking up some of those great big houses , E_S
66801:49	And \[ \[ some , \+ some \] of the people , \+ uh , some of \] the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too , are picking up some of those great big houses , E_S

66892:14	and there 's somebody in the building , watching her and all that , E_S
67006:12	Uh , but sometimes I bike to work which *T*-1 is about , uh , a fifteen mile trip each way . E_S
67025:62	I mean we 're talking , you know , forty-five , fifty minutes for biking , uh , and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind .
67032:120	Uh , so I 've been doing that less , \[ and , \+ and \] concentrating more on , you know , light biking when I get home on the evening *T*-1 and then , you know , some more on the weekends . E_S
67094:17	that would be cool sometime if I could , you know , work up to that . E_S
67105:22	they want *-1 to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour . E_S
67113:19	And I may do that sometime . E_S
67142:91	and , you know , you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle \[ that , \+ *T*-1 or \] above the age of fifteen or something , E_S
67246:19	I mean there are some people , N_S
67281:22	I try *-1 to go someplace pretty different , you know , every week . E_S
67283:13	or I 'll sometimes come in the school . E_S
67308:41	I was wondering if I was going *-1 to talk with someone that *T*-2 never has exercised before and does n't want *-3 to *?* and everything else , E_S
67340:9	\[ somebody , \+ somebody \] abandoned her E_S
67340:17	\[ somebody , \+ somebody \] abandoned her E_S
67419:50	and the dog was being house sit *-1 , or dog sit *-1 , whatever , by some friends of mine down the street , E_S
67588:39	Well the puppy jumped \[ in the , \+ into \] some of the pools but not into the , N_S
67646:26	but , uh , she could go in sometime \[ when , \+ if \] I 'm watching her , E_S
67788:18	You know for quite some time , just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty . E_S
67817:85	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ \[ they 're , \+ they have \] \+ they 're \] working on , uh , something in Austin now , E_S
67840:38	\[ but , \+ uh , uh , but \] there is something 0 *T*-1 to be said *-2 about , N_S
67861:26	But she actually killed the furrier . Or someone , E_S
67863:48	and then , then they decided 0 it was a case of mistaken identity or something . E_S
67902:35	* \[ to , \+ uh , to \] kill somebody is what it amounts to *T*-2 . E_S
67910:51	But \[ they , \+ they \] did it because they have a warped mind for some reason . E_S
67917:28	And \[ they , \+ they \] wanted something \[ worse than they , \+ more than they \] respect the human life . E_S
67948:16	Now , there 's some , E_S
67949:66	and maybe , now , I do n't remember if this *ICH*-3 is Texas or not , that *T*-1 has something about 0 all drug dealers can be sentenced *-2 to the death sentence . E_S
67962:17	\[ It 's something of the dis- , \+ they 're on the distribution \] end . E_S
68296:20	But , if there are some people who *T*-1 do n't agree uh , \[ then there must be , \+ it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be \] at least a reasonable doubt for some people . E_S
68296:115	But , if there are some people who *T*-1 do n't agree uh , \[ then there must be , \+ it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be \] at least a reasonable doubt for some people . E_S
68304:75	\[ \[ you , \+ you \] rarely hear , \+ you hear , \] of course 0 there 's cases where someone has been put *-1 \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in , \] uh , prison , uh , *-2 falsely accused *T*-3 E_S

68395:46	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] have , \+ I have \] some friends who *T*-1 do expert \[ wis- , \+ witness \] testimony E_S

68441:33	\[ \[ you , \+ you , \] \+ somebody 's \] life is in twelve people 's hands E_S

69099:40	Well , I guess 0 it depends on if you got something 0 *-2 to worry about *T*-1 . E_S
69158:94	You know , secretaries \[ are n't , \+ are n't \] really going *-1 to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something . E_S
69171:113	Well , there , N_S it 's , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 one of the problems with it is 0 it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired . E_S
69177:34	Uh , you find out one way or another if somebody 's got a problem on the job . E_S
69235:82	Well , I guess 0 that 's one of the positive things that *T*-1 \[ ha- , \+ have \] come out of it , some of the employee assistance program . E_S
69236:28	If you do test *-1 positive for something they will give you an \[ \[ op- , \+ o- , \] \+ opportunity \] 0 * to go *-3 get your life straight rather than to lose your job *T*-2 . E_S
69277:54	So that they 're sure that you have n't borrowed anybody 's , I guess , or something . E_S
69317:12	They got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests . E_S
69318:15	They 've MUMBLEx some companies that *T*-1 are doing , uh , hair tests . E_S
69325:53	and they can apparently test , um , back a certain period of time . Because MUMBLEx some of \[ the , \+ the \] residue ends up in your hair follicles , you know , E_S
69350:46	So , I guess 0 if they perfect that MUMBLEx is not quite as cumbersome as * having *-1 to go *-2 fill a bottle or give blood or something like that . E_S
69350:93	So , I guess 0 if they perfect that MUMBLEx is not quite as cumbersome as * having *-1 to go *-2 fill a bottle or give blood or something like that . E_S
69394:38	so \[ you ha- , \+ you have \] been to some family reunions , perhaps . E_S
69436:31	and , uh , you know , there 's some my age E_S
69437:19	and then there are some a lot younger , \[ an , \+ \] about four generations , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
69456:132	If they do n't , you know , they 'll say , oh we 're planning *-1 to \[ go \+ \[ so and so that , \+ \] go \] \[ to , \+ to \] a certain place that weekend with somebody else E_S
69702:22	well at least you 've got some . E_S
69752:23	and , uh , there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way . E_S
69757:17	and I spoke to somebody else *ICH*-1 this morning from San Antonio E_S
69766:19	At least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas . E_S
69843:19	Well , we could use some rain up here . E_S
69930:11	We get some when it 's this rainy *T*-1 , E_S
69961:8	for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool . E_S
70000:26	And , they have , of course , some pretty severe storms , Winter storms , snow and that type of thing . E_S
70020:52	and I guess 0 I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to try that area sometime and see what it 's like *T*-3 . E_S
70044:20	Maybe we can send you some . E_S
70211:35	I almost wish 0 I was in an apartment or something . You know , E_S
70223:19	after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes , they 'll get a little master recording on , this . E_S
70254:23	* Living in the city has some advantages . E_S
70271:21	It 's like a rat race sometimes . E_S
70273:15	That 's just something 0 I 'll never adapt to *T*-1 . E_S
70312:15	I 've got some onions *ICH*-1 out , tomatoes , E_S
70345:19	Well , I 've done some rewiring on it . E_S
70492:35	And , uh , so , we had *-1 to make some adjustments E_S
70493:29	because we really are kind of looking for something that we want *-4 to do *T*-1 and he wants *-2 to do *T*-1 that *T*-3 's satisfactory , E_S
70599:186	but it seems like there 's , um , times when we just have *-1 to get out *T*-3 where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat , going to a show or doing something *T*-4 , you know . E_S
70602:39	for it to work though , you have *-1 to do something . E_S
70607:43	because we do find that we want *-1 to go and do something or splurge for , you know , birthday for somebody E_S
70607:73	because we do find that we want *-1 to go and do something or splurge for , you know , birthday for somebody E_S
70609:127	we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they do n't know the difference at this age , you know , whether they 're JORDACHE new or whether they 're , you know , something E_S
70615:79	so . But , um , that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , \[ for- , \+ \] that *T*-1 are more , you know , nonessential items . E_S
70631:73	And I really believe that if you 're going *-1 to cut down on yourself , you need *-2 to cut down somewhat on your friends . E_S
70638:7	and something will come up and wind up * having *-1 to spend a thousand dollars , you know , on the car in two months or something , E_S
70638:84	and something will come up and wind up * having *-1 to spend a thousand dollars , you know , on the car in two months or something , E_S
70687:44	Well , uh , but I do realize that , that is realistic for some people , E_S
70786:73	so they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do another contract *-1 to restock that , to get ready in case something else is needed *-3 . E_S
70801:79	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational . E_S

70863:36	* \[ to g- , \+ to give \] you some perspective , \[ this , \+ this \] town that I had lived in *T*-1 for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded *-2 sixty-five per cent by state funds . E_S

70928:33	at least what I read *T*-1 , is that some younger people feel that education is priced *-2 \[ out of their , \+ uh , out of their , \] uh , budget . E_S
70962:5	some states they pay , uh , N_S
70963:38	in Germany or \[ in , \+ in \] England in some cases people in my income level , at least , allege that they pay up to \[ six- , \+ fifty-five \] percent of their gross income in taxes . E_S
70968:40	now it costs me money *-2 to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax , uh , uh , \[ a tax , \+ a sales tax \] which *T*-3 is getting to , uh , quite high levels , E_S

71007:25	I guess 0 I just push something here . E_S
71062:23	and I can still do \[ some , \+ some \] sorts of things E_S

71081:35	\[ It , \+ well , it 's \] always something that *T*-1 seems so odd to me E_S

71182:87	\[ and , \+ um , and then \] I have a shady area that I need *-1 to , uh , be concerned about *-4 not getting something that *T*-2 has *-3 to have sun *T*-5 , E_S
71190:31	but I like the vinca which *T*-1 is something 0 I had n't , N_S
71215:14	our favorite is something called * white half runner green beans , E_S
71240:27	and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs , , E_S
71455:47	Um , and , uh , I do toning *ICH*-1 a lot and , uh , some , N_S
71520:5	Isometrics , stuff like that . E_S
71562:15	Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling . E_S
71562:27	Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling . E_S
71568:5	some , um , N_S
71710:23	I think 0 my wife has some . E_S
71718:14	Or sand even some of them , E_S
71724:14	And there 's some that , like the different colors denotes \[ how much they , \+ how much the tension \] I guess they are *T*-4 and how easy *ICH*-3 they are *T*-1 0 * to move *T*-2 *T*-5 . E_S
71729:8	And some of them are real short E_S
71767:38	\[ \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] \+ some of the \] Nautilus equipment that I started *-1 seeing *T*-2 at the one that we used *-3 to go to *T*-4 was really interesting , E_S
71799:29	Just * to do , you know , some bicep , tricep exercises . E_S
71927:15	it 's like something around sixty , sixty-five percent or so now . E_S
72003:63	Huh . Well , I guess 0 that 's good that \[ they , \+ they 've \] got something 0 *T*-1 to keep them active . E_S
72026:14	and I see some of the problems 0 the kids have *T*-1 when they do n't have a real good family structure *T*-2 . E_S
72058:20	so . If there was some way \[ for , \+ for \] women \[ to , \+ to \] stay home even if they could work *T*-1 , you know , E_S
72059:96	there are a lot of jobs that *T*-1 are coming about , like in computers at home , and those types of things , that *T*-2 would at least in some ways , um , bridge the gap . E_S
72127:36	but we may have *-1 to give up on \[ some , \+ some \] things . E_S
72127:44	but we may have *-1 to give up on \[ some , \+ some \] things . E_S
72166:16	Mostly , uh , something , I like like true life , \[ not , \+ \] uh , you know , documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life . E_S
72192:42	I wish 0 I had *?* \[ in , \+ in \] some senses E_S
72201:8	for some reason it seems *-1 to interest me , like people that *T*-2 make a big comeback or , you know , Orel Hershiser , things like that . E_S
72217:16	but they usually have some good articles in it . E_S
72309:29	In fact , I 'd rather *ICH*-1 read sometimes than * watch T V . E_S
72338:19	If I start into something and I really enjoy what I 'm reading *T*-1 , then I have a terrible time * getting away from it too . E_S
72351:28	Even if I 'm , uh , doing something like an afghan , if I 'm close to the end , sometimes I 'll , do the same thing . E_S
72351:64	Even if I 'm , uh , doing something like an afghan , if I 'm close to the end , sometimes I 'll , do the same thing . E_S
72359:33	I 'm sure 0 it 's fast MUMBLEx or something . E_S
72367:46	I like *-1 reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes E_S
72368:20	I just sleep better or something . E_S
72402:8	and some of the people , uh , N_S
72414:59	and how you have *-1 to , uh , be aggressive and , you know , really want something for yourself and that type of stuff *T*-2 . E_S
72420:14	it 's not someone else , E_S
72431:21	I 'm not that focused on something . E_S
72442:10	If someone says , do you want *-2 to do this tonight , uh , and I got a mountain of things 0 * to do *T*-1 , it 's okay , you know ,
72465:33	\[ e- , \+ even \] though I admire someone who *T*-1 is n't , like I am *?* , you know , \[ and , \+ and \] I wish 0 I could be more that way E_S
72471:15	There may be some schools 0 you could read about *T*-1 and learn . E_S
72661:44	because , uh , I think 0 even mentally when you can do some , N_S
72672:51	because my sister worked at \[ the , \+ uh , the \] \[ Visa \+ some Bank Americard \] center there . E_S
72684:62	Uh , and they have become , \[ or , \+ \] also \[ a , \+ a \] real bother sometimes . E_S
72702:9	So , sometimes , uh , especially * traveling with T I , you know , everything goes on American Express , E_S
72739:121	\[ We keep them , \+ uh , we keep , \] uh , one gas card \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , Visa just , you know , in case there 's an emergency or , something E_S
72758:10	and for some strange reason those people think 0 they need *-1 to get paid *-2 . E_S
72778:11	and then some of them add late fees on it , if they do n't get paid *-1 E_S
72811:70	So , they 've got quite a bit more motivation I think 0 *T*-3 * to get paid *-2 then , some of the others do . E_S
72836:84	\[ and , \+ uh , but , \] \[ it , \+ you know , \[ you kind of , \+ you \] \] know that somebody every month , N_S
72861:67	I 've got three card offers *ICH*-1 now , uh , from gas companies and , uh , Visa Gold and , uh , some , , other bank , uh , E_S
72938:26	but I ca n't see *-1 paying someone to use their card . E_S
72949:62	The best philosophy is * have them if you need them , but otherwise leave them tucked *-1 away somewhere . E_S
73034:57	It takes that mixture of a very mature college student , who *T*-2 wants *-1 to do something and yet is willing *-1 to give the time , and the interest to the children . E_S
73049:29	So , um , I can see where someone , you know , in a position like that , in a live-in capacity , would definitely be the way 0 * to go *T*-1 if \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] lucky enough *-3 to have the financial MUMBLEx 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
73055:14	and that 's something that we 're struggling with *T*-1 now . E_S
73129:26	And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 .
73129:81	And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 .
73150:18	But , we also learned something from that experience as our children got older . E_S
73176:40	I think 0 that might be part of the problem with some people . You know , E_S
73193:12	That 's something altogether different , uh . E_S
73197:18	one takes piano lessons , somewhere on one afternoon E_S
73205:22	It has *-1 to be somewhere else E_S
73342:59	She never had *-1 to worry about *-3 taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older 0 *T*-2 to deal with them , E_S
73358:15	I was seeing something on the television *ICH*-1 earlier about a little girl that *T*-2 's been telling her mother these terrible stories E_S
73395:88	People are being \[ \[ a little more , \+ oh , I do n't know , a little le- , \] \+ a little less \] bigoted in some ways , E_S
73543:7	at some point E_S
73616:20	Are you D A D or something up there ? E_S
73620:20	Are you D A D or something ? E_S
73672:17	Well , I got some friends that , uh , N_S
73683:22	well , he went to school somewhere in Ohio , E_S
73794:6	some of these are urban worries E_S
73808:17	we 've been having some problem now E_S
73823:84	And , uh , I use *-1 to have *-2 to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on , \[ at \+ \] sometimes *T*-3 . E_S
73873:46	I think 0 the other thing is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns \[ in our , \+ in our \] education and the way 0 we approach things *T*-1 as of maybe starting back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2 . E_S
73883:21	if you do n't have some kind \[ of , \+ of \] basic believe or something down inside of you , then it *EXP*-1 's very difficult * to , uh , have anything 0 * to turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3 . E_S
73883:53	if you do n't have some kind \[ of , \+ of \] basic believe or something down inside of you , then it *EXP*-1 's very difficult * to , uh , have anything 0 * to turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3 . E_S

73940:12	I see some flickers \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ uh , of \] good directions turning , E_S
73963:9	and , some people just do n't have it . E_S
73981:5	some ways it 's rather frightening , E_S
73984:41	\[ it 's just , \+ it just is \] almost overwhelming sometimes when you think , \[ of , \+ of \] the jobs that *T*-1 is out there *-2 to be done *-3 , in order * to flip things back around *-6 the way 0 they needed *-4 to be *T*-5 *T*-7 , E_S
74004:82	\[ I think \+ \[ as , uh , \+ as , \] uh , mother you know , I use *-1 to think \] sometimes 0 \[ it 's not so much , \+ uh , it 's not so much \] the kids , E_S
74026:5	somebody was there . E_S
74115:47	and it 's not \[ that always \+ that the children always \] say something E_S
74180:13	So I have some rather strong opinions . E_S
74203:84	And then I would \[ provide , \+ uh , use \] the money that we 've paying them *T*-1 *-4 to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers 0 *T*-2 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who *T*-3 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time . E_S
74211:24	And then * let them try some innovative things and see what *T*-2 works . And then , uh , have some sort of mechanism for * passing that knowledge along to other teachers who *T*-1 could benefit from the same sorts of things .

74223:18	That 's , uh , some pretty good ideas . E_S
74224:19	Why do n't you do something with those *T*-1 ? E_S
74251:93	But , uh , \[ that was , \+ that 's \] the extent of which I guess 0 that 's more \[ than , \+ than \] some people , less than others . E_S
74280:27	So we 'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who *T*-2 are doing a good job and give them \[ a , \+ a \] pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *T*-3 . E_S
74280:130	So we 'd have *-1 to have some way 0 * to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who *T*-2 are doing a good job and give them \[ a , \+ a \] pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money *T*-3 . E_S
74294:25	You know , if there 's some gauge that they could make *T*-1 . N_S
74301:8	But some certain type \[ of , \+ of \] position where you 're overseen *-1 *T*-2 * to begin with . E_S
74306:14	Uh , just something 0 *T*-1 to , i- , N_S
74307:17	rather than * throw someone \[ in , \+ into \] that environment , uh , you know , it N_S
74312:18	I thought that maybe something . N_S
74315:52	at least what I used *-2 to observe *T*-3 in student teaching , was that some college kid who *T*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with , was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *T*-4 was harried and overworked and , uh , had too many kids 0 * to handle *T*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *T*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher . E_S
74360:60	Well , another thing 0 I think 0 *T*-1 would be helpful would be * to have some sort \[ of , \+ of \] say a national curriculum . Because one of the problems with * getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for , uh , curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that *T*-2 will sell in Texas and California . E_S
74404:39	And I hope 0 maybe we 're going *-1 to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid *-2 to it with , uh , Reagan 's , uh , new education secretary \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , \[ trying * to do some , \+ uh , trying *-3 to produce some \] new programs anyway . E_S

74443:58	I measured it one time , because \[ I was , \+ \] uh , we had saw some termites E_S
74583:45	I figured 0 I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to hire somebody 0 *T*-3 to remove our windows and put new ones *ICH*-6 in that *T*-4 are easier 0 * to clean *T*-5 . E_S
74598:33	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] seen some wear and tear . You know . E_S
74663:29	I mean we need *-1 to redo some , rewiring ourselves E_S
74670:11	so if something breaks , we have *-1 to shut it off from the main , in the street , you know , E_S
74697:9	lightning or something knocked it out E_S
74719:14	Well that 's something , N_S
74835:49	The neighbor 's \[ la- , \+ \] uh , washing machine had uh , over done something , E_S

74914:42	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] been done for quite some time . E_S

75188:116	It 's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4 E_S
75207:8	And some of the other ones were n't born . E_S
75325:69	But , uh , right now our neighborhood is running about , uh , eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed *-1 , sometime during \[ their , \+ their , \] uh , existence in that neighborhood . E_S
75332:25	And since that time everybody 's got some sort of burglar system or , you know , uh , burglar alarms uh , and including \[ the out , \+ uh , the outer \] perimeter type , uh , devices , sensors and things like that . E_S
75407:34	in other words , you 've increased the probability of somebody being caught *-1 a little bit . E_S
75441:55	So \[ you 'd , \+ you 'd \] rather see it harder * to convict somebody . E_S
75443:73	I 'd rather see it a little bit harder *ICH*-1 and have a little bit more evidence *ICH*-1 , uh , * to convict somebody E_S
75492:37	Well , you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something , right , and try *-1 to get money from him E_S
75572:44	then other people will wait up , you know , and wait for somebody to do something else , try *-1 to take it in their own hands . E_S
75572:54	then other people will wait up , you know , and wait for somebody to do something else , try *-1 to take it in their own hands . E_S
75584:44	\[ you can , \+ you know , you can \] get some of us , E_S
75646:91	And I think 0 one of the big things that you can do *T*-1 \[ is , \+ *-2 to increase deterrence is , \] uh , if someone is found *-3 guilty of a , uh , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship . E_S
75690:15	I have done something , uh , like that , too , only not nearly as extensive . E_S
75694:43	But it *EXP*-4 must be interesting now * trying *-1 to do something to a basic ranch , style home . Uh , after *-2 having a one that *T*-3 was historical looking . E_S
75795:23	And so , I think 0 some of the things that I did *T*-1 paid off . E_S
75796:73	For instance , one thing that I did *T*-1 that *T*-2 might even be a good suggestion for you uh , was something 0 I did *T*-3 on the outside . E_S
75835:19	They , uh , auctioned some tools and , things like that , E_S
75846:57	And , so , well , I thought , gee , I 've been wanting *-1 to , do some brick , uh , walkways for a time . E_S
75858:22	Anyway , it ended up after some pretty , uh , heavy bidding , that I got all those bricks for forty dollars . E_S
75946:38	and , you know , they have *-1 to be doing something constantly . E_S
75948:31	I do n't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something \[ \[ un- , \+ on , \] \+ on \] top of the sand and then lay the bricks . E_S
75948:49	I do n't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something \[ \[ un- , \+ on , \] \+ on \] top of the sand and then lay the bricks . E_S
75953:71	But \[ they have , \+ they have \] a problem with these little \[ tin- , \+ \] like sand bugs or something that *T*-1 drill in between all these bricks . E_S
75961:15	I did get some material and studied every bit of material that I could study *T*-1 , E_S
76007:25	if it was n't quite level or something , I 'd just get that , rubber hammer \[ \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] \+ and \] prob- , you know , N_S
76012:37	if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind I think 0 *T*-3 all 0 they need *T*-1 to do *T*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on \[ a , \+ oh , a \] fairly regular basis , for a while anyway . E_S
76012:96	if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind I think 0 *T*-3 all 0 they need *T*-1 to do *T*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on \[ a , \+ oh , a \] fairly regular basis , for a while anyway . E_S
76031:31	hopefully they 'll sell the house , and go somewhere else . E_S
76049:11	Dursban or something like that . E_S
76069:45	and , you know , she 's always telling him , is n't there something \[ that , \+ that \] you can bring *T*-1 home with you that *T*-2 kills everything that you spray *T*-3 , you know , \[ out in the , \+ out in the \] field , that you can get rid *-5 of , these bugs , E_S
76083:117	I think , uh , 0 you probably just need *-1 to make * sure that it dries , very , very \[ careful- , \+ uh , well , \] before she lets her cats out , or something , like that . E_S
76157:23	If , uh , you 've some kid \[ who *T*-2 does n't have , \+ uh , who *T*-1 's \] from a broken family , the schools are supposed *-3 to fill that void . E_S
76158:79	It 's gotten way beyond * \[ teaching , \+ uh , you know , teaching \] classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like , oh , were kind of traditionally the school 's roles . E_S
76168:38	And I was expressing my frustrations that , uh , \[ some of the , \+ so many \] problems , I work in a high school , are that kids do n't have \[ a , \+ a \] degree of self-discipline which *T*-1 may be reflected *-2 in society at large . E_S
76228:14	and this is something that I see *T*-1 . E_S
76252:42	and , uh , there really needs *-1 to be a bridge , some sort of transition for that . E_S
76267:10	And you sometimes N_S
76337:51	I mean , we 're alerted *-2 to what the moment 0 we see something *T*-1 . E_S
76424:28	I mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , \[ but \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] some ways , E_S
76424:81	I mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , \[ but \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] some ways , E_S
76448:61	It *EXP*-3 's amazing how the , you know , people 0 you talk to *T*-1 have some interesting conversations *T*-2 E_S
76676:15	But , uh , some of , N_S
76696:62	But , I play in a couple of leagues \[ and , \+ and \] occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend . E_S
76788:36	Um . I know 0 I 've seen , the sign somewhere . E_S
76907:7	And some people said to me , `` Well , that 's our wintertime . '' E_S
76952:28	what do you think 0 *T*-1 are some current trends in , uh , the way 0 families spend time together *T*-2 , based on what you 've seen *T*-3 . E_S
77001:21	and , um , * did some shopping and stuff . E_S
77041:6	some of the people that I work with *T*-1 \[ they , \+ like when I worked on second shift *T*-2 , um , \[ their paren- , \+ their kids \] \] go to school during the day E_S
77047:35	This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends , or something , you know . E_S
77104:31	\[ What 's , \+ what are \] some other questions 0 they have *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
77235:16	what *T*-1 are some of the things that you did *T*-2 with your children when they were growing up *T*-3 ? E_S
77401:34	but I think 0 it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours . E_S
77443:88	and \[ you want *-1 to be avail- , \+ at least I 've wanted *-2 to be available , \] when \[ they , \+ for some reason , \[ they had , \+ they were \] \] bouncing something off of me *T*-3 . Because it was something that *T*-4 was bothering them or they were concerned about *T*-4 , E_S

77494:31	\[ we , \+ although we \] have some relatives in the area that \[ we , \+ we \] see *T*-1 , we , N_S

77612:35	\[ to \+ today , \] where , um , sometimes I put a little gift *ICH*-3 \[ if I see something that *T*-1 's , \+ \] uh , occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save *T*-2 for \[ their , \+ their \] future *T*-4 , to sometimes , just money , uh , pieces of candy . E_S

77789:7	and sometimes I teach in the evening E_S
77808:7	and sometimes we 'd watch the weather stations . E_S
77853:41	and I know 0 they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas , E_S
77918:59	and I find that really interesting , you know , * to imagine , E_S here is *T*-1 somebody that *T*-2 was in China , \[ le- , \+ \] two years ago when all that was going on \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , Beijing *T*-3 . E_S
77935:15	they 've had some terrible problems with Hispanics , E_S
77948:24	but she also was , um , something like a , \[ t- , \+ uh , state \] auditor or something like that before this position . E_S
77948:62	but she also was , um , something like a , \[ t- , \+ uh , state \] auditor or something like that before this position . E_S
77950:33	I guess 0 she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia , at Washington . E_S
78035:34	I 've become very aware of different political views because some of the things 0 we have *-1 to discuss *T*-2 are very politically motivated or whatever , E_S
78083:105	\[ That , \+ that \] would be \[ a , \+ to me , a \] really nice vacation because \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not in physical shape for something like that ,

78230:8	so some of the things are not \[ as , \+ quite as , \] uh , adaptable . E_S

78259:112	I know that , uh , uh , \[ one of , \+ one \] thing that *T*-1 happens \[ to us \+ to \] vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family . E_S
78260:27	You know , we go wherever somebody *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 , that we have n't seen *T*-3 for a while . E_S
78292:37	I guess 0 my favorite vacation idea would be * to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep *T*-1 maybe , you know , like \[ a , \+ a \] small camper . E_S

78681:44	I try *-1 to look at \[ what , \+ if \] some of the newspaper articles , or the , N_S

79001:12	they had some bends *ICH*-1 , around that we could find and put them in *T*-2 E_S
79059:30	and then , you know , they have someone that *T*-1 comes around and pick it up , you know , every afternoon which , you know , *T*-3 is an excellent idea , at work because I know the amount paper 0 they go through *T*-2 there E_S
79075:59	there 's needs *-1 to be more public , uh , service \[ of , \+ \] programs or something that *T*-2 would let us know had \[ a \+ \] happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what *T*-3 is happening E_S

79210:82	People are becoming more conscience *ICH*-1 all the time that it 's necessary 0 * to do *T*-2 , and that we need *-3 to somehow get away from the fact that we have *-4 to have everything individually wrapped , E_S
79223:32	I 'm that 's about my , uh , some on recycling N_S
79402:37	and he said , um , * let 's give her some race horse shots . E_S
79438:84	and he said , uh , a booster , uh , every year or two , I mean , maybe every six months \[ or , \+ or \] something like that E_S
79534:27	\[ I , \+ I \] have some neighbors across the field , E_S

79729:81	There are times , \[ when it 's , \+ when it 's \] very useful *T*-1 , like , uh , emergency trip , or something . E_S
79742:63	plus the fact that it *EXP*-1 's helpful * not to have *-2 to carry a lot of money sometimes . E_S
79767:78	The other thing about them is too , 0 \[ if you really do n't , \+ you really need \] *-1 to get some and use them because if you have never used them \[ and developed , \+ and have n't developed \] a credit thing . It stops you from *-2 doing a lot of things . E_S

80193:73	Oh , \[ I would n't , \+ I could \] just see hair start *-1 growing out of my upper lip or something . E_S
80268:14	At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could *?* E_S
80284:13	she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
80319:24	And I 've been *-1 buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways 0 * to paint *T*-2 . E_S
80331:13	and you get some beautiful effects with them . E_S
80356:14	so I want something that *T*-1 's going *-2 to tie that together E_S
80438:15	Well that 's something \[ that , \+ that * 's \] worthwhile * checking into *T*-1 then . 'Cause I , N_S
80477:77	and he said 0 it *ICH*-2 's a good thing 0 I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something 0 * to drink *T*-1 and went in there I would think 0 I was having hallucinations . E_S
80516:64	so you really do n't have *-1 to be disrupted for more than about a weekend . If you have some help . E_S
80562:25	The last time 0 I had something done * *T*-1 was my kitchen cabinets E_S
80686:52	or , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] also subscribe to something called * WORLD PRESS , which *T*-1 is a magazine that *T*-2 only talks about other , \[ ex- , \+ excerpts \] from the WORLD PRESS , E_S
80845:22	Do we get enough news or something like that ? E_S

81344:38	I think 0 he 's up in a attic , or some part of school . E_S

81385:46	and a lot of times we 'll go *-1 to rent a movie or something E_S

81415:29	she pretended *-1 to be the boss or something . E_S
81438:33	And it 's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . E_S
81474:56	So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard at that point * to , you know , classify some of the builders . E_S
81517:8	maybe someday when I feel really ambitious and \[ an- , \+ get angry *T*-2 \] I 'll start *-1 poking holes up there ,
81521:143	\[ \[ ninety , \+ I would say 0 \[ about , \+ oh , about \] ninety-five \] percent , \+ no I guess 0 \[ may- , \+ probably \] a hundred percent \] of them all are mostly brick , uh , with some wood . E_S

81768:44	\[ It 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] just something that *T*-1 goes with the territory . E_S

82303:25	if you want *-1 to do something every night that 's fine , E_S

82435:13	my wife did some teaching at \[ like , \+ uh , like \] a private tutoring place . A Sylvan Learning Center this year E_S
82439:141	and so \[ that , \+ that \] got me \[ to sp- , \+ to be able *-1 to spend \] more time with the kids at night and stuff , you know , 'cause normally \[ if , \+ if \] they need something they just go to mom . No matter what it is *T*-2 , E_S
82541:39	but \[ then , \+ then \] again , you know , some , N_S
82579:91	And I really think that that 's one of the problems 0 the nation 's facing *T*-1 that , you know , we need *-3 to do something about *T*-2 , E_S
82612:82	Well , you know , in the next year or so , you 'll see so many instances where , you know , he 'll mimic something that you 've done *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
82690:38	Uh , we 're probably making a comparison against , uh , some European \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , uh , s-s-say , newer republics \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 have very high percentages . E_S
82753:56	but part of the process also is that you must \[ register , \+ preregister \] at some particular point . E_S

82832:83	\[ * to \+ \] \[ if you , \+ if you \] go on the attack , \[ i- , \+ \] and put some sensational thing before the public , as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign , N_S and it is not refuted *-1 , E_S people will , you know , uh , believe it . E_S
82833:49	If you do n't refute it , as he did n't , there must be some truth to the matter , see . E_S
83047:35	But you know that just made me think of something that *T*-1 happened down here in Dallas last year . E_S
83054:14	And this is something that *T*-1 had been going on for months . E_S
83060:57	\[ y- , \+ \] N_S you know , I think that you have really hit on something there . E_S
83086:23	Uh , I know 0 in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required *-1 . E_S
83086:34	Uh , I know 0 in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required *-1 . E_S
83087:10	And indeed some juries are no longer twelve people , E_S
83131:50	but in Florida now , uh , uh , uh , \[ at eighteen years , \+ someone was just sentenced *-1 to eighteen years , \] I heard it on TODAY , uh , without any specific recommendation for , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , * waving the normal , uh , procedures . E_S
83132:31	And the eighteen years will , uh , translate into something like , uh , four point seven , \[ \[ if every , \+ if the , \] \+ if the \] prisoner is a model prisoner , E_S
83139:29	Plus , I guess , 0 there was some credit for time 0 this guy had already spent in jail * waiting for trial *T*-1 . E_S
83187:159	But I know 0 you have a right * to ask for a jury \[ in , \+ in \] any sort of a case that even where damages \[ \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ are , \] \+ uh , are \] the result of some sort of \[ a , \+ uh , an \] action that you are bringing *T*-1 against someone else *T*-2 . You can ask for that to be heard *-4 before a jury . E_S
83187:214	But I know 0 you have a right * to ask for a jury \[ in , \+ in \] any sort of a case that even where damages \[ \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ are , \] \+ uh , are \] the result of some sort of \[ a , \+ uh , an \] action that you are bringing *T*-1 against someone else *T*-2 . You can ask for that to be heard *-4 before a jury . E_S
83194:55	* Takes a heck of a long time , I guess , * to get there in some states . E_S
83253:46	\[ so has our , \+ I guess 0 our population has \] grown some too . E_S
83302:39	Uh , after the case was over , I was like , somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way 0 they did *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know . E_S
83337:116	\[ they only , \+ I think 0 they only , \] uh , found him guilty on one count . \[ Which *T*-1 was , uh , not even , \+ which *T*-3 was a class something felony . Which *T*-2 was not even \] punishable , uh , uh , to the degree that they thought 0 it . E_S
83345:98	maybe when you are there \[ in the r- , \+ in the courtroom \] yourself and you are sitting there and you have got *-1 to make a judgment on somebody *T*-2 . N_S
83398:22	Uh , I bel- , something like sixty-nine dollars , \[ som- , \+ something \] on that order . E_S
83398:48	Uh , I bel- , something like sixty-nine dollars , \[ som- , \+ something \] on that order . E_S
83423:17	but there 's just some little difference that , um , *T*-1 causes it not to work an i- , N_S
83438:7	and somehow that broke off E_S
83462:18	yo- , * borrowed somebody else 's jack E_S
83468:62	so after *-1 buying the filter and all the oil , you 're looking at ten bucks at least , or somewhere in there
83484:28	and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it E_S
83548:29	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , somehow or another they 'll give you an option * to leave a message E_S
83553:12	I know someone that *T*-1 did that , E_S
83609:24	It was starting *-1 to burn some oil . E_S
83631:7	and some people will still buy them , you know , E_S
83762:34	And I just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff . E_S
83765:12	There was some plants that *T*-1 are just Spring bloomers E_S
83797:35	So I just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down . Because I want them to come back up next year . E_S
83827:75	About the only \[ bloom , \+ bulb \] that *T*-1 repeats well in my area is the , uh , uh , daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb . E_S
83830:17	Now I have got some daffodils . E_S
83850:28	The blooms 0 *T*-1 are , on some of them is yellow , purple , white . Just all different colors . E_S
83878:12	It is some type of lily . E_S
83884:16	I have got some in the backyard that *T*-1 bloomed blue . Which I \[ would not , \+ would have \] liked *T*-3 those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better . And then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color . With little purple spots that \[ it , \+ *T*-2 it \] will fade into a solid purple . E_S
83884:123	I have got some in the backyard that *T*-1 bloomed blue . Which I \[ would not , \+ would have \] liked *T*-3 those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better . And then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color . With little purple spots that \[ it , \+ *T*-2 it \] will fade into a solid purple . E_S
83951:64	and I just threw them on the side , * intending *-1 to transplant them or throw them away or something . And forgot about them through the whole Winter . E_S
83972:12	It is some type of iris though . E_S
84112:30	And * is sold *-1 as Purple Buddy or sometimes sold *-1 as straw flower . E_S
84174:22	at New Years , we had some people come in and , uh , like attack one of the planes . Because they were protesting , uh , the presence over in the Persian Gulf . E_S
84277:32	I mean , they are eighteen to twenty-four , some of the young men and women . E_S
84280:5	sometimes it is the same people \[ that *T*-1 have been , \+ that *T*-2 have been \] observed *-3 E_S
84290:46	in a small town in Wisconsin , near Madison , um , a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun . And killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters . E_S
84345:58	I mean , \[ I do not , \+ I see it \] in work place too , sometimes . E_S
84352:32	It is an attitude like the world owes them something . E_S
84428:72	I mean , \[ I , \+ you know , I mean , I \] go to like an aerobics class or something . E_S
84492:21	She is on the east coast somewhere . E_S
84532:63	And my husband is the kind of guy , 0 \[ he 's , \+ *T*-1 he 's \] sometime , N_S
84534:13	And I think sometimes 0 it is just , 0 he and I are very different in terms of that . E_S
84656:67	I mean , people that *T*-1 may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something . E_S
84656:75	I mean , people that *T*-1 may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something . E_S
84660:52	They wanted *-1 to see what it *EXP*-3 was like *T*-2 * to kill someone . E_S
84676:66	\[ \[ \[ I- , \+ i- , \] \+ it is , \] \+ yeah , is n't it \] something ? E_S
84722:73	Well , Wayne , I , uh , feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children , and making time available even sometimes when time is n't available *T*-1 . E_S
84791:127	because if , uh , kids do n't look up to you , \[ or , \+ or , \] \[ ca- , \+ ca n't \] feel 0 they can spend time with you , they 're going *-1 to find someone else E_S
84821:30	And the wife says , Well , you need something 0 * to do *T*-1 , E_S
84841:36	Likewise , \[ we , \+ uh , we \] do some projects every now and then . E_S
84882:66	so it *EXP*-2 's kind of hard for me to tell what *T*-1 would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland , E_S
84899:9	interestingly some of the information 0 I 've been reading *T*-1 indicates that the amount of air pollution from , uh , uh , airplanes is extraordinary . E_S
84907:17	and that 's always something that , you know , \[ you just do n't real , \+ you do n't think \] about *T*-1 . E_S
84919:39	I happen * to \[ r- , \+ just read \] something the other day
84952:42	it *EXP*-1 's really out of the norm * not to find something that *T*-2 is n't air conditioned . E_S
84982:128	but demanding that , uh , we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed *-1 toward , um , improvement of polluting vehicles , and not just cars but also buses , um , planes . That something can be done *-2 .
85094:33	\[ So , \+ uh , but \] it is something that *T*-1 's a little frightening E_S
85117:87	\[ But , \+ um , so , \] \[ \[ I , \+ i- , \] \+ I 'd \] be interested in *-4 having spoken with somebody *ICH*-1 also from the far west on this issue *-2 to see how \[ they , \+ their \] attitudes are *T*-3 . E_S
85174:28	And * let 's hope 0 \[ some , \+ there are other \] people that *T*-1 feel the same way . E_S
85177:5	something happen . N_S
85345:59	and that 's what he said *T*-1 was that , you know , it just was n't something that people had *T*-2 down there . E_S
85372:19	Um , E_S there are some areas *ICH*-2 though \[ where , \+ where \] they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit \[ into the , \+ to the , \] uh *T*-1 , N_S
85376:21	or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , \[ just a little , \+ just a little \] bit , some more than others . E_S
85376:69	or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , \[ just a little , \+ just a little \] bit , some more than others . E_S
85529:106	I guess 0 we 're going *-1 to have a lot of parades *ICH*-3 this weekend in honor of these guys \[ that *T*-4 are , \+ that *T*-2 did \] some stuff over in the Gulf .
85596:64	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 , you know , I 'd like you to maybe express something here . E_S
85605:6	somewhere in there someone 's going *-1 to have *-2 to learn a different way . E_S
85605:14	somewhere in there someone 's going *-1 to have *-2 to learn a different way . E_S
85613:41	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , , I think 0 some different things *ICH*-2 could come from what *T*-1 's happened *T*-1 , than what we expect *T*-3 . E_S
85736:59	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we may not have ever have seen that without some of these , uh , newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , soldiers leaving , um , you know , surrendering and , trying *-1 to get out of that situation . E_S
85748:22	you have *-1 to have some compassion some humanness . E_S
85748:27	you have *-1 to have some compassion some humanness . E_S
85755:36	but , you know , for heaven sakes , that 's something that *T*-1 's been *-2 going on for ages , E_S
85797:50	and they were talking that , \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ something \] like this , N_S
85806:62	but for dependent coverage I 'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars \[ a , \+ a \] month or something like that . E_S
85818:18	but if you had something like one of these , uh , health maintenance programs , E_S
85823:162	or one of , whatever the type name is *T*-1 , H M O , uh , \[ where the , \+ uh , where \] you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *T*-3 . If you tried *-2 to buy something like that , \[ I 'm prob- , \+ it would probably \] be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something . E_S
85823:239	or one of , whatever the type name is *T*-1 , H M O , uh , \[ where the , \+ uh , where \] you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *T*-3 . If you tried *-2 to buy something like that , \[ I 'm prob- , \+ it would probably \] be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something . E_S
85857:115	but , you know , if you do n't have a doctor anyway normally it does n't really make much difference . Because you can , you know , \[ if , \+ if \] you find someone 0 you really like *T*-1 N_S
85946:28	so they , have *-1 to absorb it somewhere else . E_S
85980:52	\[ Our , \+ our \] insurance \[ is , \+ uh , is \] doing something similar where they 're also going *-1 to mor- , N_S
86064:12	in fact some of the days we froze . E_S
86107:43	The only thing 0 I did n't like *T*-1 was 0 in some of the more touristy areas uh , um , \[ the , \+ it \] would just be besieged *-2 by people wanting * to be your guide E_S
86111:29	and \[ you , \+ \] there were some places , where people , defini- , N_S
86145:23	what we did *T*-1 in some of the other cities E_S and they tell you *-1 to do that is * to hire a local guide E_S
86155:30	and it 's like ten dollars a day or something E_S
86477:24	but you figure 0 you got some drug guy out there that *T*-1 's got an Uzi machine gun , uh , a thirty-eight , uh , E_S
86575:26	anyway , E_S I think 0 if somebody shoots somebody , they ought *-1 to be shot *-1 . E_S
86575:32	anyway , E_S I think 0 if somebody shoots somebody , they ought *-1 to be shot *-1 . E_S
86665:132	but , uh , still I think 0 they ought *-4 to know how * to use one *T*-1 and that it 's not just a toy and that \[ when , \+ \] it 's not like on T V when someone gets shot *-2 *T*-3 , uh , they get back up . E_S
86670:9	If someone gets shot *-1 with a , real gun they do n't get back up . E_S
86698:46	but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something E_S
86732:58	You know , I do n't want *-1 to get out there *-2 deer hunting and have some guy blow me away , E_S
86784:11	there 's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington . Regardless of the racial makeup , E_S
86799:158	when , uh , previous secretary of , uh , educa- , Bennett , I think 0 his name was *?* , became the drug czar , uh , for , uh , President Bush *T*-3 , he was going *-2 to focus \[ on it , \+ on \] this area and do something about it E_S
86825:48	You know , \[ the , \+ the \] immediate need * to show some sort of violence *-1 to settle \[ th- , \+ the \] argument . N_S
86828:64	\[ And , \+ and then \] \[ I , \+ I \] am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree , E_S
86846:12	that 's some of the things 0 I think *T*-1 about it , E_S
86852:65	it seems anymore , uh , 0 a movie can not be considered *-1 good unless there 's just \[ some , \+ some \] sort of violence , or something in it . E_S
86852:75	it seems anymore , uh , 0 a movie can not be considered *-1 good unless there 's just \[ some , \+ some \] sort of violence , or something in it . E_S
86852:93	it seems anymore , uh , 0 a movie can not be considered *-1 good unless there 's just \[ some , \+ some \] sort of violence , or something in it . E_S
86858:45	and \[ it has no , \+ \] there 's no call for something violent , E_S
86859:30	\[ but , \+ so \] they just throw something in there * just to say 0 they have it . E_S
86870:101	it has *-1 to be even , uh , magnified *-2 * \[ to \+ to \] attract people 's attention . I guess , to have them spend money on something like that . E_S
86896:94	And \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] have *-1 to think \[ that , \+ that \] it has some influence on it . E_S
86913:41	and they were just really coming down on him because of \[ some of the things 0 he was , \+ just some of the things \] that he believed in *T*-1 , some of his morals . E_S
86913:74	and they were just really coming down on him because of \[ some of the things 0 he was , \+ just some of the things \] that he believed in *T*-1 , some of his morals . E_S
86913:109	and they were just really coming down on him because of \[ some of the things 0 he was , \+ just some of the things \] that he believed in *T*-1 , some of his morals . E_S
86946:29	Well , nobody feels responsibility * to do something . E_S
86970:36	it does seem *-1 to be a higher need for something of that sort . E_S
86999:9	\[ some , \+ well a lot \] of it can be contributed *-1 to \[ th- , \+ the \] racial differences , I mean , just that we are so close , to the border with Mexico , E_S
87098:73	but , um , uh , uh , \[ when , \+ when \] we entertain *T*-1 I usually try *-2 to find something that *T*-3 will be , um , kind of \[ h- , \+ good \] for everybody E_S
87099:26	and \[ that 's , \+ that sometimes means \] 0 you ca n't do gourmet , because depending on who your guests are *T*-1 . E_S
87122:21	Uh , she ca n't eat some cream cheese . E_S
87129:69	it makes you , uh , keep *-1 looking for recipes every time 0 you have an eye out , for something like , N_S
87281:7	and somehow I did n't want *-1 to do that because it , N_S
87309:16	I guess 0 some of the best things 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 , um , \[ I , \+ \] some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know . E_S
87309:72	I guess 0 some of the best things 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 , um , \[ I , \+ \] some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know . E_S
87581:16	and then he said something , because his English was so poor \[ on , \+ for \] the most part , E_S
87598:345	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ uh , I think 0 I 'm , \] \+ I think 0 I 'm , \] uh , a little out of the ordinary in \[ that , \+ that \] \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] think 0 I 'm more worried about \[ the deficit , \+ the national deficit \] \[ than , \+ than , \] uh , a lot of other people are *?* and think that \[ we need *-1 to , \+ we need *-2 to \] either raise our taxes \[ or , \+ or \] cutback on something E_S
87657:24	That would provide , uh , possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *T*-2 , see . E_S
87657:43	That would provide , uh , possibly some relief there * to utilize some of the property taxes for other things *T*-2 , see . E_S
87696:47	If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that , and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and , uh , construction costs were cheap *T*-1 , you could afford it . E_S
87727:7	and some , people do n't even own a car and know how * to drive a car *T*-1 . E_S
87765:75	we saw about them traveling to San Francisco *-1 to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something . E_S
87802:20	Well , see that 's something 0 I want *-1 to see *T*-2 , E_S
87862:106	Because \[ that , \+ that \] just reminds me of , you know , like back in school E_S and , you know , the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something . Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble E_S
88033:26	And that was * taking over somebody else 's freedoms . And sort of trampling that E_S
88037:57	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] you know \[ it , \+ it \] meant something bigger I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
88228:25	Um , usually , uh , word processing something , um , such as , oh , forms for things , uh , N_S
88253:13	and there 's some , N_S
88289:32	and we 're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing , here . E_S
88318:25	ours really needs *-1 to have some work done *-2 on it E_S
88330:11	I did some typing for my father when he had the company *T*-1 E_S
88362:23	and also , um , I do some work at U T D E_S
88375:6	some of the commands just had nothing 0 * to do *T*-4 with , you know , \[ what you were supposed *-2 to be doing *T*-3 \+ \[ what they , \+ what they \] did *T*-1 on the \[ com- , \+ computer \] \] E_S

E_S
88429:48	so , um , \[ if you , \+ um , unless you \] have some other things 0 you want *-1 to talk about *T*-2 as * having *-3 to do with P C -s . N_S
88465:44	although , um , I have also done oh , free lance magazine writing and some educational writing . E_S
88467:13	So I did some advertising and P R E_S
88485:17	I 'm anxious *ICH*-1 some day * to have one here . E_S
88490:60	and they just talked \[ to \+ \] the \[ other day \+ other day \] about * setting something up again E_S
88684:70	and at that age \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] \[ kind of , \+ kind of \] difficult sometimes . E_S
88718:56	You know , I was not going *-1 to try *-2 to pick *ICH*-3 and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled E_S
88724:108	\[ But , \+ uh , so \] when you are first going to school *T*-4 \[ that , \+ \] you kind of have the luxury of *-1 being able *-2 to have some latitude in * choosing the place 0 * to go *T*-3 . E_S

88836:33	\[ I , \+ I \] was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year . E_S
88890:185	So , \[ there , \+ There \] was one mother who , uh , *T*-1 came by right , even , before we started , \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-2 obviously was , uh , very interested in *-3 getting \[ her , \+ her \] daughter in \[ or , \+ or \] having gotten her daughter in or something E_S

89007:12	What are some others that you have seen *T*-1 lately *T*-2 ? E_S
89092:13	And there were some others , E_S

89235:14	and I enjoy some of the Michael J . Fox movies . E_S

89384:65	\[ I , \+ I , \] kept *-1 thinking of Omar Sharif every time 0 I saw that name somewhere *T*-2 , E_S
89403:17	And I think 0 somebody told me 0 it 's also on a creek side lot , heavily wooded off the golf course . E_S
89427:42	so , I think 0 the high end is definitely , you know somewhere there . E_S
89480:49	And we thought 0 that was important instead of * getting swallowed up in something that you know . N_S

89500:21	And it *EXP*-1 takes them something like , thirty days * to complete a house . E_S
89612:14	So this is something that *T*-1 is , N_S
89689:33	and I also feel that that 's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from *T*-1 . Is when people have *-2 to put people in a nursing homes *T*-3 E_S
89695:84	and , uh , they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who *T*-1 \[ had , \+ had , \] uh , apparently inhaled some chicken 0 he was eating *T*-2 . E_S
89707:31	So , I told them 0 he strangled on some chicken E_S
89739:35	Well , \[ I , \+ \] this was just something that \[ I was , \+ I witnessed *T*-1 \] to . E_S
89792:72	and the first thing that *T*-1 happens you have *-2 to share \[ your , \+ your \] whole living space , with someone that you have never known *T*-3 before in your life . E_S
89800:27	but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there E_S
89843:64	And \[ \[ it was , \+ she was , \] \+ it was \] just like * keeping something . E_S
89875:46	on N_S I think 0 it was *RNR*-1 Romain Drive or Romain Street or something , there in Los Angeles , E_S they used * to have a , N_S or , I guess 0 they still do , uh , E_S had a , uh , uh , big warehouse kind of thing , which *T*-3 had offices E_S
89885:12	he had some accomplices that *T*-1 were kind of suspect , E_S
89957:24	I am sure 0 there is something out there , uh , MUMBLEx , E_S
89963:36	I thought 0 she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years . E_S
90102:57	the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday \[ or , \+ or \] Christmas or something will send me \[ another , \+ another \] good book E_S
90148:12	that 's something new to me . E_S
90151:12	It is something new , E_S
90187:12	or is this something that maybe * learning phonetics , E_S
90205:31	And I kept *-1 saying to the teacher , something is wrong here . E_S
90228:26	and I said , you know , something is wrong , E_S
90275:14	but that 's something that parents , I think 0 *T*-2 , are able *-1 to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child *T*-3 . E_S
90279:23	So , because , that 's something 0 you can do *T*-1 by just enrichment types of things in the home E_S
90416:38	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere \[ where they , \+ where they \] said that , you know , these children , \[ they , \+ they \] had *-2 to be the best *T*-1 , E_S
90416:49	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere \[ where they , \+ where they \] said that , you know , these children , \[ they , \+ they \] had *-2 to be the best *T*-1 , E_S
90501:30	and it was not only in Mississippi , in some other places , as well , E_S
90648:22	I think 0 that 's some of it . E_S
90694:58	but , then again , uh , well , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] have some aunts that , uh , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do *?* *T*-1 . E_S
90731:17	You have , read something about what *T*-1 is going on and about their children and so forth . E_S
90771:19	So you probably could give some great advice . E_S
90836:155	\[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I 'd , \] \+ I 'd \] advise a parent *-1 to send a kid to a school *ICH*-2 , though , that *T*-3 has a number of different types of programs , you know , E_S that , uh , some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer *T*-1 , E_S
90837:9	but some of \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the small , \] \+ some of the larger small \] schools , you know , I guess 0 around three or four thousand students \[ have a , \+ \] can offer a broader range of curriculums and things , E_S
90837:49	but some of \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the small , \] \+ some of the larger small \] schools , you know , I guess 0 around three or four thousand students \[ have a , \+ \] can offer a broader range of curriculums and things , E_S
90857:46	and I always say * make * sure 0 you major , in something that you like *T*-1 , even if it 's not going *-2 to be your career vocation , because you 'll get better grades . E_S
90862:138	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 most employers would probably rather *ICH*-1 hire , you know , \[ a , \+ a \] three six \[ in , \+ um , in \] history , uh , * to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration . E_S
90873:46	I always , you know , tell them that you should major in something 0 \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-1 to get good grades in *T*-2 . Because \[ that , \+ that 's \] always , I think , more important , you know , overall . E_S
90940:61	\[ yet , \+ like , say , you know , the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something , might have some top specialists in my area . E_S
90940:73	\[ yet , \+ like , say , you know , the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something , might have some top specialists in my area . E_S
90947:64	Yet , \] if I go to U of I or C M U or , you know , \[ some , \+ you know , any \] big name school , my quality of education might not be that much better , E_S
90987:60	Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools *T*-1 , I applied to some big programs *ICH*-2 , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which *T*-3 is recognized *-4 in the Northeast \[ as , \+ as , \] you know , one step below M I T in a sense , you know , E_S
91042:34	So you 've really , uh , I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything . E_S
91057:27	But , you know , \[ at some of the large schools , \+ I know that \[ \[ at , \+ at , \] \+ at \] University of Maryland \] where I am *T*-1 , you know , in a P H D program , \[ I , \+ I \] have n't even met , uh , someone outside of my area of information systems except for , N_S

91063:23	and then yesterday I talked with someone \[ with , \+ \] from Pennsylvania , E_S
91088:21	\[ and , \+ and \] sometimes I just ca n't wait that long , E_S
91122:77	and \[ it was , \+ um , it was \] called *-1 , um , SMART WOMEN , I think . Um , or something like that . E_S
91282:63	but \[ I , \+ as I say , I \] was pretty much ashamed that I had n't read something before then . E_S
91296:89	And then when Jennie had *-1 to read it at Gettysburg *T*-2 \[ and \+ \] \[ I got her the , \+ I got \] her someone , N_S
91300:34	I think 0 it was , um , oh , some actress reading it . E_S
91318:57	And now \[ I , \+ I mean , I \] think 0 it 's around here somewhere , E_S
91323:51	I 'm just going *-1 to have *-3 to put it , in the car sometimes and listen to it . E_S
91335:47	um , N_S usually I try *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] find something long that , I 'm going *-2 to , N_S
91357:15	I 'm doing some reviews of books , *-2 \[ just to , \+ \] \[ what , \+ \] to sort of recommend \[ to \+ \] \[ wh- , \+ whether \] or not a full-scale review should be done *-1 for the journal , E_S
91406:48	Oh , \[ that , \+ that \] would be wonderful * to read something like that . E_S
91411:37	and \[ he really , \+ this man really \] shed some light on , um , some , aspects \[ of \+ of \] Bach 's genius \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and , \] \+ you know , the , \[ and \+ \] more sociological things , you know , like \[ the , \+ the \] idea \[ that , \+ um , that \] \[ music , \+ \] * to be a musician was as much , um , of a family occupation as anything .

E_S
91585:10	but usually sometimes every few summers . E_S
91679:52	\[ Every , \+ every \] family brings \[ a , \+ a \] dish of some kind , E_S
91904:40	And it was , uh , just * to , uh , have some fellowship with her . E_S
91957:44	So that 's probably my favorite place when I have *-1 to go somewhere on a vacation *T*-2 . E_S
91983:14	we stayed at some park E_S
92015:136	and I think 0 \[ they really \+ it really \] \[ pen- , \+ penetrates \] in your memory , you know , what * to do *T*-1 , because you really have a great interest in it . Because it 's something 0 you were n't forced *-2 to do *T*-3 , E_S
92049:54	I mean , \[ there \+ there 's \] a little bit , because there 's some of those English words that you just do n't exactly know what they mean *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
92120:42	Then \[ I , \+ I 'd \] love *-1 to go somewhere in Asia , E_S
92128:5	somebody that *T*-1 knows their way around . E_S
92186:12	There were some people at the next table who *T*-1 spoke English , E_S
92256:10	And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE , E_S
92256:18	And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE , E_S
92357:29	\[ We , \+ we \] do that sometimes . E_S
92373:9	Just some of the times they 're continued *-1 , E_S
92439:35	they call it the night of the howling , or something like that , E_S
92491:27	and I guess 0 maybe there are some parts of that , E_S
92495:118	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , I guess 0 mostly \[ I , \+ I \] like the news shows *ICH*-1 too , the news magazines , like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY , TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that , you know , \[ all , \+ all \] of those shows , if I can do it , E_S
92509:28	and I like , uh , gymnastics , and some track and field , E_S
92526:30	or I may be working around in the room somehow , E_S
92528:27	\[ I , \+ that 's \] something that *T*-1 comes from your old age , you know . E_S
92552:41	Or like at six thirty I 'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that . E_S
92575:12	That 's something 0 I did n't think that we 'd ever do *T*-1 . E_S
92598:48	maybe you saw in the paper this morning that , um , they 've had some problems with , the recycling on plastic , E_S
92682:31	and so it was n't , you know , something that *T*-1 was being picked *-2 up E_S
92685:53	and I thought wow , \[ that 's , \+ that is \] wonderful , that somebody MUMBLEx does that . E_S
92808:34	or , if she \[ needed * to wrap something for , \+ needed , \] uh , sandwich paper or something , she 'd use that . E_S
92808:66	or , if she \[ needed * to wrap something for , \+ needed , \] uh , sandwich paper or something , she 'd use that . E_S
92857:5	some people \[ are compl- , \+ now are complaining \] because the stuff is n't picked *-1 up at the curbside , you know , E_S
92946:48	I think that it has *-1 to really hit home before , the message sometimes . E_S
92950:102	Or you have *-1 to grow up with it being \[ im- , \+ important \] in your life , um , oh , oh , um , before the message really takes hold sometimes . E_S
92959:94	I mean , like \[ I , \+ I 'd \] go \[ to the , \+ um , to the \] U T D , um , cafeteria for lunch sometimes E_S
92971:53	I wonder if , you know , maybe I need *-1 to bring that to someone 's attention , you know , E_S
93017:41	Or they will go *-1 dump it out in the middle of some ocean . E_S
93069:93	and then \[ once , \+ about once \] every three or four years I try *-1 to get over to England , because I lived there for a while , some years back . E_S
93104:64	Well , uh , \[ we , \+ we , \] as you do , take family vacations , uh , sometimes one a year , E_S
93178:47	And , uh , I guess 0 we just like *-1 to go \[ someplace , \+ someplace \] entirely different . E_S
93178:56	And , uh , I guess 0 we just like *-1 to go \[ someplace , \+ someplace \] entirely different . E_S
93357:13	so they took some time off that , uh , they could show us around . E_S
93418:7	and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle . E_S
93463:49	it 's like * feeding little babies food and telling them 0 it 's something else so that they 'll eat it . E_S
93514:94	so even though I can look at it as a task , \[ the , \+ \] you know , \[ I kind of get the , \+ I get some kind of \] global benefit from the whole thing by *-1 saying , Well , I 'm lowering my chance of heart attack , and \[ thus , \+ that \] type stuff . E_S
93541:6	something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable . E_S
93552:42	* Going to the gym \[ is , \+ is \] actually something different \[ than , \+ than , \] like , N_S
93571:57	\[ \[ You , \+ you , \] \+ you \] take the time *-1 to relax some how E_S
93625:24	and I need *-1 to find some place 0 I could go *T*-2 and not feel like there 's all these people who *T*-3 are just huge and hulking that *T*-4 are ... N_S
93630:12	that 's something that *T*-1 comes with time , too . You know , E_S
93696:100	and what *T*-1 's real funny about plans is that there 's a struggle \[ between , \+ \] uh , \[ \[ when you , \+ when you add something to your life *T*-2 , \] \+ when you add a plan to your life *T*-3 , \] E_S
93697:6	something else has *-1 to go away E_S
93723:14	That 'll come some day when I , N_S
93773:15	* must be some Italian spices in there . E_S
93871:32	for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some , um , tomato sauce in it , E_S
93927:30	or it 's always good on top of something in the sandwich . E_S
93946:101	\[ I thought , \+ oh , *-2 \[ taking this , \+ you know , taking this \] as a dip , I thought , \] gosh , you know , sometimes when we have it at home *T*-1 it , it turns dark on the top so quickly , E_S
94026:25	there 's supposed *-1 to be something more healthy about it . E_S
94088:77	and this has been going on \[ at least , \+ uh , I would say , at least \] twenty-five years or thirty , something like that . E_S
94094:50	Maybe longer than that , I 'm going *-1 to get back into the fifties sometime . E_S
94118:46	and we found that if it 's in a certain part of Texas , some people come , E_S
94142:35	And then they have generally a show or an auction or something *ICH*-4 on Saturday night 0 *T*-3 to help *-1 raise funds 0 *T*-2 to cover the costs of such . E_S
94177:7	So sometimes when these other families get together *T*-1 , they 're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids , E_S
94220:7	and some just come in for Saturday E_S
94225:29	and it 's a chance * to see some of the relatives 0 you do n't see *T*-1 all year long except that once a year . E_S
94240:44	and I think 0 we 've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that , E_S
94285:16	And * choose , some place that everybody 's going *-1 to like *T*-2 as far as food and all that . E_S
94341:15	there have been some really wild shows put * on there . E_S
94375:12	and , uh some people do E_S
94379:7	and some people do n't . E_S
94473:20	but , you know , some that *T*-1 are *?* um , \[ \[ that , \+ they 're , \] \+ they 're \] not quite the same as the kids that *T*-2 are going to the inner city , uh , you know , public schools . E_S
94490:53	\[ It shows , \+ I think 0 it shows \] that the parents have some , uh , desire \[ for , \+ for \] the kid to \[ do , \+ do \] well , you know , E_S
94509:26	and I think 0 this is happening some around the country in terms of , um , morals , * trying *-1 to teach the kinds of things \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 are n't getting taught *-3 at home , \[ \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] \+ and \] respect for other people . E_S
94569:132	and , um , \[ about , \+ I guess 0 about \] \[ when the first , \+ when the youngest \] one was in kindergarten *T*-2 I started *-1 working at a preschool and , uh , you know , doing some work , E_S
94704:29	And they have *-1 to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning . E_S
94794:154	But when time came *-6 to direct their ability 0 * to make choices to develop the kinds of things \[ that , \+ that \] they 're going *-1 to need *T*-4 *-2 to interact with other people *T*-3 *T*-5 , I felt like I needed some strong influence there . E_S
94890:29	but they 're going *-1 to learn it sometime , E_S
94939:11	I do some P C stand alone work on it , E_S
94994:24	Um , well , I actually do some work , *-1 working at M I T and at NIST , National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington , E_S
95087:41	Oh , that 's \[ a , \+ an \] ambulance or something going on here , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
95110:93	I \[ ca n't talk on th- , \+ ca n't do this \] much later than now , between sort of like six , five thirty and six thirty or something like that , because the traffic outside , they honk the horn so loud 0 I ca n't even hear the phone call . E_S
95128:17	Uh , I know someone who *T*-1 has *?* , E_S
95130:15	She told me some of the things 0 you can do *T*-1 , E_S
95167:11	I do some E_S
95181:14	It 's got some pretty strong competitors . E_S
95186:29	people told me that it was sort of cumbersome 0 * to use *T*-1 . E_S
95229:10	Um , sometimes I get called *-1 late at night at home because there 's a production problem , E_S
95230:78	and that gives me the opportunity * to , uh , come in to work and fix it , if I ca n't think of some thing 0 * to tell the trouble shooter *T*-1 while we 're on the phone . E_S
95236:81	Um , I also , uh , handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who *T*-1 need *-2 to find out something connected * , E_S
95240:42	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that *T*-1 have happened lately , that I think 0 there are some occupations \[ that they should , \+ \] such as the health field , the transportation field , uh , N_S

95246:99	so , \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] feel like it should be mandatory in some professions , E_S
95252:64	\[ I , \+ I \] especially agree that if it 's an area where they could cause somebody else , you know harm or injury *T*-1 , absolutely . E_S
95260:5	sometimes I think 0 they carry it a little bit too far . E_S
95358:121	and I think 0 that 's the only reason 0 I have a problem with it *T*-1 , when \[ there 's no , \+ you know , there 's no \] reason 0 * to suspect someone *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know . E_S
95370:25	that way you ca n't feel like somebody 's out *-1 to get me . E_S
95384:109	\[ I would , \+ I would \] rather *ICH*-2 have it that way , * to know that I was chosen *-1 at random by a computer than * to think that somebody turned me in because \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ there 's , \+ \] when you let other employees turn in people *T*-3 , N_S

95426:40	you know they could n't hurt me with their ten key or something , E_S
95430:36	but out on the line , they 've got people working some serious equipment . E_S
95440:131	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] just think 0 employers have *-1 to have , \+ * especially given today , the drug abuse that *T*-2 goes on , I just think 0 employers have *-3 to have \] some kind of way 0 * to see that they 're not being put *-7 at risk *T*-6 .

95449:39	\[ and , \+ and \] I 'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims are n't due to , uh , illnesses brought * on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse . E_S

95507:16	If I had something 0 * to hide *T*-1 , it 's one thing , E_S

95516:93	\[ And , \+ and then \] they say , well , if you give them the right * to do this , then they 're going *-1 to take some other right away from you , E_S

95577:47	So , I think 0 it *EXP*-1 is probably better * to have some sort of \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ at least a \] record E_S
95578:67	but my dad was so precise , that , I mean , if it said * to spend eleven percent on something that 's what *T*-1 it was spent *-2 . E_S

95795:44	so we have had , uh , once again , you know , \[ some really , \+ a real \] lean year for us . E_S
95833:189	And I , think that that 's the way that we looked at it *T*-1 in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school *T*-2 that there was a light at the end of that tunnel . You know , \[ that \+ that \] it *EXP*-3 was worth it * to save and to not have , uh , something and , uh , in return know that something better was going *-4 to be at the end of it E_S

95858:17	and I can take some real great tours to Europe . E_S
95928:120	And , uh , I guess 0 for places 0 I like *-1 to go *T*-2 , I enjoy *-3 going to the beach and \[ \[ having , \+ having outdoor , \] \+ being outdoors \] somewhere . E_S
95934:84	\[ as far as , \+ \] \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like *-1 going somewhere where it 's not so hot *T*-2 . And being able *-3 to be outside , enjoy \[ outsor- , \+ outside \] activities , E_S
96024:12	they have some , but not , not so much . E_S
96028:44	Um , if you go further down , uh , you will usually find some , but not right in there . E_S
96094:45	you will need *-1 to try *-2 to go and , stay there sometime . E_S
96156:55	\[ We will head for , \+ we will head for \] Florida , maybe in somewhat of an off season , instead of summer . E_S
96199:34	\[ Are you , \+ uh , are you \] someone who *T*-1 works outside your home , E_S
96252:12	we have some engineers that *T*-1 still ,
96309:12	There was something on T V *ICH*-2 the other day that *T*-1 said that fewer than one or two percent of the \[ \[ heads of , uh , \+ chairmen of the board , \] \+ \[ chair- , \+ chair persons , \] uh , \[ if you sa- , \+ if you will , \] of the board \] are women in this country . E_S
96320:19	So , there are \[ some , \+ some \] strides 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 there . E_S
96320:28	So , there are \[ some , \+ some \] strides 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 there . E_S
96339:138	And , uh , uh , I guess 0 \[ \[ \[ my , \+ I , \] uh , the one , \] \+ my one \] bad thing is \[ that I am , \+ that I wish \] 0 my mother had had some of those opportunities , because , I think 0 \[ she would have really , \+ she rea- , would have \] succeeded in a lot of ways , \[ that men , \+ that women \] were not able *-1 to succeed *T*-2 , in her , generation . E_S
96371:41	So , \[ she is pretty much , \+ although there were some other women in her class , she was , \] you know , uh , one of the minorities ,
96435:16	Oh , I know something . E_S
96462:35	\[ And so . \+ But \] I know 0 some of the other services do not think that women are capable of *-1 doing the job . E_S
96466:37	\[ they were . \+ I was \] listening to some of the comments on \[ ra- , \+ television *ICH*-1 \] the other day , uh , about it , E_S
96478:43	but I just would rather have , uh , a man *ICH*-1 doing some of these jobs than a woman . E_S
96482:12	There 's some men out there that *T*-1 are more feminine than most women . E_S
96486:174	You know , \[ Neil , \+ well Neil \] as far as I am concerned *-1 , and MUMBLEx I could be wrong about this , \[ but \+ \] the only one area where a woman could not do it *T*-2 is if she just physically did not have the strength , * to do something . E_S
96600:105	because , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I placed all but one or two of my calls . And , uh , only because I going *-1 to make some money , E_S
96703:14	It 's , some good , some bad , uh , E_S
96703:21	It 's , some good , some bad , uh , E_S
96826:19	or we really do develop some health problems . E_S
96918:79	\[ I was rea- , \+ I was really \] looking forward to summer , thinking oh , we are going *-1 to have some time off . E_S
97143:12	I have some friends that *T*-1 have children ,
97185:20	well hopefully I can do some consulting work at home . E_S
97278:7	and some were just different objects that *T*-1 \[ have , \+ had \] a definite purpose for kids , you know , E_S
97282:14	and there 's something about their eyes . E_S
97329:57	so \[ it , \+ you know , it \] would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place . E_S
97407:28	And , you know , * maybe do some free lance type work at home . E_S
97460:30	and * \[ have , \+ have \] some kind of real good program , set *-1 up so that \[ you , \+ when you \] go *T*-2 you can be assured that if there 's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid E_S
97464:29	\[ or , \+ and \] * have some kind of program set *-1 up , like you say , * to stimulate the kids , or educate them in some manner .

97552:6	some of the changing roles of women in that respect , I have been a product of *T*-1 . E_S
97733:46	\[ They are , \+ they are \] really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower . E_S

97754:46	even if they want *-1 to *?* , they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss *T*-2 . E_S
97812:24	And I think 0 there are some people that *T*-1 have done that , E_S
97963:34	and , uh , we 'll try *-1 to rent something that they can see *T*-2 as well as something else that we can see *T*-3 E_S
97963:64	and , uh , we 'll try *-1 to rent something that they can see *T*-2 as well as something else that we can see *T*-3 E_S
98004:20	but we can generally find something at the store 0 for them to watch *T*-1 . E_S
98066:59	\[ I think 0 you , \+ \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] something 0 I think 0 you \] would enjoy *T*-1 , E_S
98215:5	something like that . E_S
98294:27	Because it just was not , uh , something back in the sixties that uh , I even had *-1 to worry about *T*-2 . E_S
98335:28	well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , N_S
98340:25	but the thing is , 0 if somebody ruined their life , uh , society did n't try *-1 to then save themselves from it , E_S
98350:30	but now we tend *-1 to believe 0 somewhere in the health care system otherwise , E_S we need *-2 to take care of people even if they have , you know , physically ruined themselves . E_S
98388:23	well , \[ th- , \+ some of that , \] N_S
98398:45	\[ but , \+ but \] basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality . E_S
98412:86	but nowadays , there 's so much on TV \[ where , \+ where \] people seem *-1 to have the idea 0 they can get something for nothing *T*-2 . E_S
98417:43	and I see , 0 unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars 0 you can have *T*-1 uh , for mental duress or whatever *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S

98473:7	and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and \[ his , \+ \] dented it everywhere , E_S
98498:26	\[ that , \+ those \] are some important points . E_S
98518:110	uh , but then when you quantify things *T*-3 and \[ that \+ \] might also hold criminal trials for how many years *T*-1 is appropriate , uh , that they might leave it to somebody else who , uh , *T*-2 has expertise in that . E_S
98532:93	and , uh , as a say , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-1 to be around , uh , civil cases because I 've been an expert witness some , N_S
98534:37	and one thing that you get *T*-2 if you have some expertise is , uh , you know the range \[ of , \+ of \] possible values or terms or , you know , how heinous was the crime *T*-1 . E_S
98539:19	when I only do something one , two or three times *T*-1 I 'm hardly an expert on it , E_S
98551:5	some people just sit on them once in their lifetime , you know , if they 're that lucky sometimes . Or , you know , \[ what , \+ whatever \] the case may be *T*-1 . \[ And , \+ and \] may not have any idea of \[ what , \+ what \] the standard punishment *ICH*-2 would be *T*-3 for it . E_S

98568:30	The only thing 0 I worry about *T*-1 sometimes is \[ if , \+ if \] you get somebody *ICH*-5 *ICH*-6 in there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 has a name , that *T*-3 is the defendant and , you know , sometimes , might have more pull , which \[ *T*-4 that \+ \] does happen . E_S

98573:68	I mean not everybody \[ \[ is , \+ you know , has , \] \+ has \] the right morals sometimes . E_S
98578:7	and sometimes that 's not real fair either , though E_S
98600:108	\[ and , \+ and \] his attorney gets his \[ sentences , \+ sentencing \] reduced *-1 because he 's gone to a lesser charge , like , I do n't know what , assault or something or , N_S

98671:69	but , uh , somebody did it , just for your train of thought where \[ they , \+ they \] showed something *T*-1 E_S
98712:24	Well , What I wear *T*-1 sometimes depends \[ on , \+ on \] how cold I think 0 the school might be *T*-2 or what room I might be in *T*-3 since I 'm a sub , and have different rooms 0 * to go to *T*-4 . And always carry a sweater . E_S
98723:39	But , you do n't know , uh , I guess at some of the other schools 0 you go to *T*-1 unless you 've been there . E_S
98733:75	And \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting * to notice when you go to different schools *T*-2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual , uh , N_S
98735:31	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 some of the dress codes are different at different schools . E_S
98753:20	and , well , for me sometimes , they even have * dress up days E_S
98762:52	And one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *T*-2 . E_S
98764:25	And you never know that , though sometimes when you 're going in *T*-1 , do you ? E_S
98789:21	\[ and , \+ and \] sometimes you get the long term stuff E_S
98802:9	because some of the teachers 0 I know *T*-1 wear , uh , dress up jeans , not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they 've had *T*-2 dry cleaned *-3 so they have got the crease E_S
98813:74	I think 0 the elementary school teachers , or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier \[ than , \+ than \] some of the high school teachers , I think . E_S
98822:24	And you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at Clark , they 're all pretty fancy . E_S
98822:40	And you can see 0 in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at Clark , they 're all pretty fancy . E_S

98860:6	some of those male coaches , that might really , N_S
98924:11	Well , some of them , yes they do E_S
98925:33	\[ and , \+ and \] it 's not at some of the private schools , E_S

99175:5	some schools I know 0 *T*-1 give , uh , oh , N_S
99199:26	and she may end up *-1 doing something with that . E_S
99204:91	And I 'm , you know , showing them 0 if you 're strong in math and science , kiddos , this is one area where women can make some decent money *T*-1 . You know . E_S
99208:86	I mean , I 'm kind of really putting the practical application , you know , \[ and , \+ and \] saying , yet , * do something that you enjoy *T*-1 . E_S
99218:30	Well , it sounds like he 's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
99306:46	You know , and here it was like , pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime E_S
99396:31	That 's enough * to , uh , do some boating E_S
99480:45	\[ So \+ but , \] uh , you know , we probably did some ice skating on it , E_S
99488:18	Christmas time , uh , some of our relatives would come up from Alabama , E_S
99518:27	And I remember *-1 getting up and somebody telling me , hey , better * wait * to go to work because the roads are all , you know , snow . E_S
99557:50	even the couple of ice storms I 've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit . E_S
99558:15	I mean , sometimes the ice is pretty bad , E_S
99777:23	And as soon as we use something , you know , we crush it up and put it out there E_S
99786:38	And , uh , I feel like at least we 're doing something . E_S
99791:14	and they said something about how you do n't realize 0 even just your small contribution *T*-1 ,
99954:48	We 're *-1 to discuss a little bit about the process of * putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis E_S
99980:60	Then she was starting *-1 to \[ get , \+ uh , you know , lose \] memory sometimes \[ and , \+ which \] *T*-2 is kind of frightening when she 's in the car *T*-3 . E_S
100066:25	Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in *T*-1 . E_S
100078:88	But , I remember 0 from her checking around , she ended up *-1 staying at the Arkansas House I think 0 *T*-2 out in Arlington , something like that . E_S
100088:21	They 're always saying that somebody 's going *-1 to *?* , E_S
100089:8	and some of them , I think 0 *T*-1 unconsciously do it , you know , as a just , you know , half seni- , N_S
100094:8	And sometimes \[ the , \+ the \] help there does it , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
100102:51	you know , * go to the dining room \[ and , \+ and \] eat some good meals . E_S
100121:26	Usually there has *-1 to be some wealth involved * , which *T*-2 is great , \[ \[ if , \+ if \] you 're financially , \+ \[ if , \+ if \] you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money \] E_S
100122:41	but \[ the , \+ the \] places like Presbyterian Village and some of \[ the , \+ the \] retirement places \[ where , \+ where \] they have different levels of care *T*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better , as far as elderly people adapting . E_S
100168:48	And that scares me \[ the , \+ the \] thought of * forcing somebody to do something . E_S
100168:57	And that scares me \[ the , \+ the \] thought of * forcing somebody to do something . E_S
100172:50	and I mean , it *EXP*-1 's hard \[ for , \+ for \] someone like me to understand that E_S
100220:29	Well , they fear *-1 being dependent on somebody . E_S
100232:15	She 'll let something slip E_S
100301:46	I guess 0 \[ that 's MUMBLEx , my , \+ that 's something that my \] family has always believed strongly in *T*-1 , E_S
100302:47	and , uh , I had opportunities in high school , * to work in some programs , um E_S
100336:20	Well , I think 0 sometimes through groups and organizations , um , N_S
100340:29	Um , but I do know 0 through some organized groups like Scouts and church um , they , do still have opportunities . E_S
100356:13	And that was something , uh , I think 0 *T*-1 in the fifties and sixties , um ,
100387:52	\[ and , \+ and \] I know , 0 a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest E_S
100411:91	and \[ maybe , \+ uh , maybe \] this would be a way 0 * to get that feeling back *T*-1 . Um , if we 've lost some of that E_S
100443:14	There 's always something , no matter how young , E_S
100448:12	that 's something that I think that *T*-1 has been lost *-2 in families E_S
100456:28	if you 're trying *-1 to do something , even with food drives N_S
100457:14	and , uh , sometimes what Richardson and Plano both , N_S
100498:28	I 'm glad that there are still some areas \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 get the youth involved *-2 in that sort of thing . E_S
100547:39	But from * talking to people in other districts there are some major problems , uh , with dropouts . E_S
100552:7	and sometimes they did n't even show up for class E_S
100646:89	And schools now are supposed *-1 to solve social problems , uh , mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try *-2 to provide them with some security . E_S
100662:20	And I was talking to somebody that *T*-1 teaches in a middle school E_S
100771:88	And * let everyone have an opportunity * to reach higher education if they 're willing , you know , *-1 to work and have , uh , some ability . E_S
100781:22	I believe 0 it 's something like that , E_S
100962:37	and if you do you get them once a week or something , you know . E_S
100975:13	This is something that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff 0 they do *T*-3 . E_S
100975:51	This is something that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff 0 they do *T*-3 . E_S
100990:12	So , in some ways I think 0 *T*-1 \[ the , \+ the \] day schools do serve those purposes . E_S
101020:26	was that in your home or in someone else 's home ? E_S
101028:27	So you were able *-1 to have somebody come there . E_S
101039:16	or did you have someone that *T*-1 lived in with you ? E_S
101092:17	Um , it 's some kind of advisory board *ICH*-2 0 they 've put *T*-1 together for parents and children E_S
101284:21	And they get pretty particular *ICH*-3 sometimes in what they want *-1 to have *T*-2 . E_S
101442:31	I guess 0 it 's the texture , or something . E_S
101464:12	Is n't that something ? E_S
101475:56	Um , and you can make a lot at one time when I needed *-1 to make something 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] give somebody *T*-2 . You know , like , you know , to take *T*-2 over to somebody 's house or something else *T*-3 . E_S

101537:103	\[ it , \+ it 's , \] as much as you want *?* , you know torn * up \[ and , \+ and \] rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery E_S
101548:7	and some hard-boiled eggs . E_S
101736:15	I 've had some from Plano , too . E_S
101836:20	but it seems like , some of these even ladies \[ that , \+ that *T*-1 'll \] work and have , a baby and then , you know , after two or three months , go back to work . You know , E_S
101885:41	They do n't want *-1 to stay home with the kids or something like that . E_S
101949:46	That 's pretty sad because , I mean , I do n't know , something 's got *-1 to change with the schools . E_S

102074:45	So , when we go out *T*-1 , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and fajitas now . E_S
102074:92	So , when we go out *T*-1 , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and fajitas now . E_S
102087:22	And I 'm not fond of some of those things E_S
102125:102	uh , \[ \[ we 've , \+ uh , we 've usually , \] \+ we often \] save those and ventured out on , from there , uh , just for something that *T*-1 had a high rating . E_S
102128:67	We have found , uh , a number of restaurants either through D \[ and \+ \] the , Friday paper and sometimes \[ the , \+ the \] OBSERVER . Which my husband usually picks *T*-1 up . And also through coupons . E_S
102162:70	I mean it 's wonderful , particularly if you have more than two people and you 've got say four or something like that . E_S
102175:5	sometimes I think 0 * going out *-1 to eat \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] sort of a recreation . E_S
102183:135	So , uh anyway . I guess , uh , 0 \[ as far as , \+ as far as \] service when we go out *T*-1 gosh , \[ it 's nice , \+ it *EXP*-2 's nice \] * to have someone come and wait the table . And clear the table and , N_S
102238:31	You 'd like it especially it you 're adventuresome . E_S
102273:14	And , uh , sometimes we 'll go , you know , E_S
102325:20	I went to dinner with some friends last weekend E_S
102544:8	but some of the different things 0 we 're doing *T*-1 , uh there 's just not \[ a time , \+ enough time \] 0 * to do it all *T*-2 E_S
102616:31	my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie 's age *T*-1 . E_S
102638:28	Well , we do \[ s- , \+ some \] dining out . E_S
102740:38	my in-laws also enjoy prime rib , when they 've had some of their specials on Sunday , Monday , or Tuesday night *T*-1 E_S
102813:15	well , and breakfast sometimes E_S
102890:54	and it 's filled *-1 with what , whip cream \[ and , \+ and \] strawberries and something ? E_S
103023:20	but I know 0 in some areas , \[ \[ \[ it 's really , \+ it , \] \+ it really is \] bad . E_S
103029:5	something 0 we were watching *T*-1 the other day N_S
103063:12	that 's something that Europe did n't do *T*-1 right away E_S
103072:23	\[ From , \+ from \] something that the car \[ was , \+ uh , was \] giving *T*-1 , E_S
103101:43	It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are *?* , at the thought of nuclear . E_S
103109:5	some people are really afraid * to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid 0 it could become , uh , bomb quality . E_S
103110:139	But , that 's the only sensible thing 0 * to do *T*-2 , is * recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater *T*-1 . E_S
103112:48	The best answer , of course , would be solar or , uh , fusion , or something clean . E_S
103119:29	\[ I , \+ I \] get that sometimes , um , E_S
103120:13	my line gets some static . E_S
103172:75	It 's just , you know , a possible solution in the future , I think 0 *T*-1 , * maybe to help in some ways . E_S
103192:43	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 with * solving some of the \[ energy , \+ future energy \] problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . E_S
103192:87	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 with * solving some of the \[ energy , \+ future energy \] problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . E_S
103248:15	We 'll have some interesting discussion , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
103252:70	one of the reasons that I 'm against it *T*-1 is that , uh , um , I 'm afraid of someone losing their life , for \[ s- , \+ \] um , wrongly , E_S
103262:167	\[ one of the arguments , that \[ really , \+ I really \] actually have been kind of ambivalent about *T*-1 it , \+ but one of the arguments that *T*-5 really , uh , made me feel kind of strongly against it , \] is that , uh , you know , someone said to me once , well , * imagine if the person 0 you love *T*-2 most in the world , like your mother or something , if someone killed her ,
103262:243	\[ one of the arguments , that \[ really , \+ I really \] actually have been kind of ambivalent about *T*-1 it , \+ but one of the arguments that *T*-5 really , uh , made me feel kind of strongly against it , \] is that , uh , you know , someone said to me once , well , * imagine if the person 0 you love *T*-2 most in the world , like your mother or something , if someone killed her ,

103267:60	and I thought , well , the loss that I would feel *T*-1 at *-2 losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person
103268:28	no matter how rotten they were *T*-2 , somebody loves them . E_S
103332:28	but you know I guess 0 to some people it *EXP*-1 'd almost be better *ICH*-2 * to die to them than * to spend life in prison or whatever
103334:59	\[ but \+ uh , you know , but \] that would be a situation where if somebody 0 you know *T*-1 was gon *-2 na be , you know N_S
103336:51	But , uh , you know , when \[ I , \+ you \] find somebody just like that situation *T*-1
103338:33	\[ And , \+ and \] when you find someone like that , that you know 0 *T*-1 is guilty *T*-2 , he confessed already to * killing eleven \[ \[ I , \+ I 'd , \] \+ you know , I \] guess 0 I have a hard time * feeling merciful toward him , E_S
103413:142	, I mean , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not saying 0 \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ capital murder \+ or capital punishment \] is the perfect solution in every case , you know , especially because there are some cases when you just do n't know *T*-1 E_S
103456:48	\[ and , \+ and , \] \[ it really is n't , \+ for some people \[ tha- , \+ \] who *T*-1 have been there for over , and over , and over , it really is n't , \] uh , as bad . E_S
103511:255	but \[ I , \+ I \] really think that \[ in , \+ in \] terms of like this , \[ I 'd , \+ I \] think that \[ it , \+ it \] might not be such a bad thing . Because , \[ I do n't know that anybody , \+ \[ w- , \+ \] \[ in- , \+ \] I do n't know that anybody \] would feel good , you know , like if you let someone like that loose in your community . E_S
103532:37	So , it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard * to choose sometimes . E_S
103535:68	I guess 0 \[ I enjoy , \+ I enjoy \] \[ jazz , \+ * listening to jazz \] sometime although I do n't feel like I have a \[ \[ good , \+ g- , \] \+ good \] understanding of it , or \[ a good , \+ a good \] feel for maybe what *T*-1 's good jazz and what *T*-2 's not , E_S
103537:14	and , uh , sometimes I enjoy *-1 listening to , uh , fiddle music . E_S
103655:23	it 's like Elijah , or something like that . E_S
103715:5	somebody played it . E_S
103717:37	Well , I mean , but you did n't have oboe or something with it ? E_S
103741:63	\[ Not , \+ not , \] you know , the bouncy , you know * sing along kind but some of the \[ old , \+ older \] ones that N_S
103748:5	some , I do n't even , I recognize \[ the , \+ the \] melodies , and whatnot , E_S
103766:35	or it *EXP*-1 makes an elegant wedding * to have something else . E_S
103775:50	it 's kind of haunting , you know , \[ on , \+ on \] some of the notes . E_S
103800:45	\[ does it , \+ does it \] offer , like band , or some of the instruments ? E_S
103833:76	it 's just one of those things 0 I 'm just going *-1 to wait and see if he 's interested in something *T*-2 , you know . E_S
103862:120	And , uh , it kind of makes me listen a little closer \[ to , \+ to \] the piano when I hear it at other places *T*-1 , or when I , you know , \[ see some , \+ see and hear \] someone playing *T*-2 . E_S
103862:141	And , uh , it kind of makes me listen a little closer \[ to , \+ to \] the piano when I hear it at other places *T*-1 , or when I , you know , \[ see some , \+ see and hear \] someone playing *T*-2 . E_S
103886:24	and I could n't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just 0 everybody \[ was , \+ was \] waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were *T*-1 . E_S
103984:73	and so outside my little town , we would , uh , go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something . E_S
104064:16	Well , there 's someplace , you know , E_S
104069:62	and , uh , so all 0 you have *-1 to do *T*-2 is * just place it somewhere and churn it E_S
104086:57	but I 've trimmed trees and other things which , uh , *T*-1 end up *-3 being something that , *T*-2 clearly wo n't decompose nearly as rapidly , E_S
104240:18	And \[ there 's some , \+ I think 0 there 's some \] good Disney movies fixing * to come out on video , uh , SHIPWRECKED . E_S
104240:43	And \[ there 's some , \+ I think 0 there 's some \] good Disney movies fixing * to come out on video , uh , SHIPWRECKED . E_S
104265:40	Well , I 'm glad *-3 to know that there 's somebody else out there that *T*-1 does n't get *-2 to go to the movie theater . E_S
104293:14	And , uh , someone said 0 that was a lot of fun 0 * to go *-1 do *T*-2 . E_S
104338:66	Oh , \[ that 's the , \+ that 's the \] one where they burn down the house or something *T*-1 E_S
104378:90	So as far as at home use , uh , we 'll pick up a six pack *ICH*-1 every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something E_S
104404:23	I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time . E_S
104481:18	they can get more somewhere else . E_S
104525:45	And then once in a while I 'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I do n't want *-1 to \[ re- , \+ \] go back to work *T*-2 . What I enjoy *T*-3 about * staying home . E_S
104558:104	GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that *T*-1 kind of sets around for \[ when , \+ uh , when \] I 'm really have time and I really want *-2 to read something *T*-3 , you know . E_S
104581:11	and if something caught my eye , then I might read something , E_S
104581:36	and if something caught my eye , then I might read something , E_S
104589:11	I got some good recipes from them sometimes , E_S
104589:24	I got some good recipes from them sometimes , E_S
104612:58	and once in a while I buy that new magazine called * FIRST *ICH*-1 on the newsstands or something like that . E_S
104627:10	Well , sometimes , \[ if , \+ you know , if \] you 're \[ in transportation , \+ in public transportation \] I know that people will read them on something like that . E_S
104627:102	Well , sometimes , \[ if , \+ you know , if \] you 're \[ in transportation , \+ in public transportation \] I know that people will read them on something like that . E_S
104642:27	I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we , N_S
104652:47	\[ If I , \+ if I \] go on an airplane ride or something , I 'll stop in and pick up \[ a , \+ you know , a \] COSMOPOLITAN or something 0 * to read *T*-1 on the airplane . E_S

104662:19	I got into computer work somewhat , uh , E_S
104668:36	and it was just above my head without * having someone *ICH*-1 there 0 *T*-2 to give me the advice as I went along . E_S
104674:70	\[ I \+ , when I \] bought the computer *T*-1 , all of a sudden I was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail . E_S
104708:16	Uh , there 's some , uh , N_S
104752:40	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want *-1 to give to *T*-4 . Uh , be it through different organizations , March of Dimes type , uh , telethons \[ or , \+ or \] bicycle rides or whatever , how they fund whatever , uh , illness they wish *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
104815:44	but , uh , had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else , N_S
104848:55	probably just for our own safety when we 're traveling and things *T*-2 that would be something 0 I 'd like *-1 to know that *T*-3 's going on . E_S
104864:30	And if they are trying *-1 to hide something , then I have *-2 to know that , because \[ we 're t- , \+ we 're talking \] major liabilities . E_S
104874:47	\[ I , \+ I \] have a real fear , E_S but that at some point something 's going *-1 to happen . E_S

104877:47	\[ they sh- , \+ they ought \] *-1 to start *-2 doing something with the drugs . E_S
104882:15	Uh , \[ some people just , \+ uh , I 've heard some people just \] talking in our group of friends that they just feel 0 it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that , E_S
104882:43	Uh , \[ some people just , \+ uh , I 've heard some people just \] talking in our group of friends that they just feel 0 it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that , E_S
104946:39	Well , and , you know , if they do find someone \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 is , uh , having a problem with drugs E_S and they can get them the help that they need *T*-1 . As opposed to *-2 just letting the problem go on \[ with , \+ without \] any , uh , support . And whatever , N_S
105028:21	but , uh , we did some water skiing *ICH*-1 , of course , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * driving around the lake in the boat
105078:21	I 'd kind of like , someday , *-1 to maybe end up on a pair of skis \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 does n't have a , uh , well , N_S what they call *T*-3 trick skis . N_S
105090:12	You need somebody 0 *T*-1 to kind of tell you what * to do *T*-2 , E_S
105096:8	maybe someday \[ I 'll \+ , I 'll \] get back to that \[ as , \+ after \] the kids are up and grown and the monies *ICH*-2 are there 0 * to get away for times on end , weekend or something *T*-1 . E_S
105096:138	maybe someday \[ I 'll \+ , I 'll \] get back to that \[ as , \+ after \] the kids are up and grown and the monies *ICH*-2 are there 0 * to get away for times on end , weekend or something *T*-1 . E_S
105145:34	I just kind of join up when it 's something interesting *T*-1 E_S
105287:50	So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip . E_S
105307:24	Now we did , what we sometimes do *T*-1 since we are in Ohio E_S
105309:18	we will fly to something like , N_S
105331:42	I think 0 \[ our next car , \+ I would like something like \[ a , \+ an \] economy car \] that *T*-1 gets really good mileage and , uh , one that *T*-2 's really reliable . E_S
105333:11	but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra . Or something like that , uh , E_S
105333:29	but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra . Or something like that , uh , E_S
105337:5	something 0 my husband , N_S
105352:15	It sounds like something 0 your husband would drive *T*-1 , right ? . E_S
105359:37	but when we were looking *T*-2 we were looking for something that *T*-1 had enough seat belts , of course , E_S
105365:23	I think 0 that 's something 0 we might want *T*-1 , too , is some kind of standard transmission *ICH*-2 at least rather than automatic . E_S
105365:54	I think 0 that 's something 0 we might want *T*-1 , too , is some kind of standard transmission *ICH*-2 at least rather than automatic . E_S
105370:37	We 'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime E_S
105376:105	I think 0 we would want one that , even though it was a compact car or whatever that *T*-1 it would still be nice enough that , uh , you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed . E_S
105386:62	\[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] hard for people * to get in with a two door sometimes . E_S
105423:46	but I think 0 our latest \[ sat- , \+ statistic \] said 0 something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were , uh , testing negative \[ on all the dru- , \+ \[ on , \+ on \] all the testing . \] E_S
105449:34	because I think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *T*-1 to get them off of drugs . E_S
105494:61	they could just go off the deep end \[ \[ on , \+ on a , \] \+ on something \] uh , that whatever they 're taking *T*-1 at the time N_S
105526:53	and I think 0 it *EXP*-2 's good that they 're trying *-1 to start some programs down in the elementary schools . E_S
105755:48	and I 'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown Cleveland , something like that . E_S
105896:30	I 'd have *-1 to go back through some expense reports . E_S
105900:41	But particularly , down in your area , I 'm looking for \[ some , \+ some \] more restaurants . E_S
105900:50	But particularly , down in your area , I 'm looking for \[ some , \+ some \] more restaurants . E_S
106008:5	sometimes I 've been *?* when I thought , Well , it was n't as good *T*-1 , E_S
106021:28	This is going *-1 to give me some more places 0 * to go *T*-2 . E_S
106036:20	Oh , I thought 0 sometimes they say , you know this is three minutes or whatever . E_S
106068:20	but I think that at some times it can be the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
106076:38	because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days *T*-1 . E_S
106148:12	she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day . E_S
106188:20	well , I think 0 sometimes when people get *-1 to be a certain age *T*-2 , other people have *-3 to kind of help them make decisions . E_S
106196:54	well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S
106233:12	I helped someone repaint an apartment , E_S
106242:38	so , you know , you 'd have *-1 to hire someone if you needed *-2 to paint inside your house or something E_S
106242:72	so , you know , you 'd have *-1 to hire someone if you needed *-2 to paint inside your house or something E_S
106250:27	And the second one was 0 I bought some toys \[ at a , \+ um , at a \] craft fair . E_S
106289:67	I had *-1 to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands * to go *-2 buy some paint thinner , \[ and MUMBLEx \+ and \] everything like that , E_S
106295:21	if you dripped it on something , as long as you wiped it up , it was real easy 0 * to clean *T*-1 . E_S
106322:95	Well , um , so * to speak , I had *-2 to paint \[ this , \+ uh , the \] inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some , um , farm equipment in *T*-1 E_S
106478:81	but I 'm usually the one that *T*-1 sits down and puts the pencil to the paper \[ and , \+ and \] tries *-2 to somehow make the ends meet , which , uh , N_S
106667:17	One time we tried something that *T*-1 really worked E_S
106678:13	And then for some reason * taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form , uh , causes you to realize how much *T*-1 is left *-2 . E_S
106797:46	And so , \[ that , \+ that 's \] the difference there where sometimes like I know 0 if we 've had an especially bad month and we 're just almost getting down to payday , then I think 0 if we could really budget *T*-1 , N_S
106814:69	But * \[ to , \+ to \] have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes I 'll spend less on groceries but we 'll go out . E_S
106889:37	And I think though that we need *-1 to have some liquid *ICH*-3 around that you do n't have *-2 to go through the company *-5 to get *T*-4 . E_S
107084:7	And sometimes you might have two or three . E_S
107099:26	And there are , you know , some places that *T*-1 will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff . E_S
107112:21	So , when you see something that *T*-1 's on recycled paper *T*-2 , they 've actually gone to a lot of expense *-3 to do that . E_S
107124:44	but there 's really a big cost incurred * when you do recycle something *T*-1 . E_S
107178:48	I have a friend who *T*-1 just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *T*-2 . E_S
107257:19	Oh , and I know somebody that *T*-1 lives there , E_S
107341:30	and I think 0 we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think 0 they have more humidity . E_S
107364:68	And , uh , if you have that on a regular basis in Texas , I think 0 I would go with something very dry *-1 to keep it off , you know . E_S
107427:21	I have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing , E_S
107433:47	\[ \[ I , \+ It , \] \+ I \] have worked in some campaigns E_S
107455:13	And I think sometimes , you know , N_S
107456:89	that 's one thing that I have learned *T*-1 \[ in *-2 w- , \+ working in \] elections and things is , you know , 0 sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4 . E_S
107456:109	that 's one thing that I have learned *T*-1 \[ in *-2 w- , \+ working in \] elections and things is , you know , 0 sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4 . E_S
107477:21	So , uh , there was something else 0 I was going *-1 to , N_S
107521:7	and sometimes it *EXP*-1 's nice * to be able * to go ahead of time and vote because , you know , if you 're going *-2 to be tied up that day , uh , * campaigning or whatever it might be . Um , 0 that \[ kind of , \+ just kind of \] takes that load off , you know , E_S
107540:43	and I do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this *T*-1 . E_S
107569:86	So I kind of know \[ how it *EXP*-4 is * to , \+ how *-1 to \] decide if you want *-2 to put somebody in a rest home *T*-3 E_S
107574:19	like twenty-four hours a day someone , has *-1 to be ,
107575:17	Well , there 's someone in \[ my , \+ my \] fiancee 's family . E_S
107654:131	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , he 's the one because he 's the one that * is n't going to work every day and that she moved in with *T*-2 when she needed *-3 to move in with someone *T*-4 . E_S
107678:35	so if my parents do need *-1 to live with someone , it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers *ICH*-3 around and everything 0 * to care for *T*-2 . You know , E_S
107694:76	But I wonder how much , you know , if one of us is going *-1 to have *-2 to quit work someday or retire early or something . E_S
107694:89	But I wonder how much , you know , if one of us is going *-1 to have *-2 to quit work someday or retire early or something . E_S
107733:57	and maybe they should *?* , you know because we 're all going *-1 to get old someday . E_S
107811:32	I guess 0 you have *-1 to take some things and leave some things . E_S
107811:42	I guess 0 you have *-1 to take some things and leave some things . E_S
107924:98	The , um , thing \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have *-2 to dress real professionally for a meeting or something *T*-3 is 0 I wear a clerical collar and a suit and , uh , all of that sort of thing , E_S
107928:71	but when I do n't need *-1 to dress up for \[ a , \+ a \] meeting or a service of some sort *T*-2 , I do n't . E_S
107939:32	and they 've told me *-1 to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds , E_S
107978:81	so \[ you do n't have *-1 to , \+ you do n't have *-2 to \] buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do *T*-3 . E_S
108098:52	I was waiting so long \[ for , \+ uh , for \] it to find somebody .
108150:96	uh , lot \] of the shows \[ that , \+ that \] I 've liked *T*-1 in the past , like , uh , oh , GOLDEN GIRLS E_S and , some of them tend *-1 to get so risque , E_S
108151:41	and when you have children uh , watching it *T*-2 , that sometimes really starts *-1 to bother me E_S
108203:42	There always seems *-1 to be that kind of value in there somewhere . E_S
108309:68	uh , \[ I , \+ I \] like things that , uh , *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] wholesome , I guess . E_S
108364:6	some of the punk , um , when I was in high school *T*-1 , that was , uh , one of the big things , was punk music , E_S
108365:80	and , uh , \[ a lot of it \[ is , \+ has \] a lot 0 *-3 to say *T*-2 , \+ or some of it has a lot 0 *-4 to say *T*-1 , \]
108372:78	Uh , well , \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's , \] \+ it \] really expresses some of the opinions \[ of , \+ of \] the people who *T*-1 enjoy the music E_S
108385:11	Um , some of it , um , E_S
108418:16	and then \[ some of it is , \+ some of it actually gets \] into some serious discussions of problems \[ in our , \+ in urban society . \] E_S
108418:34	and then \[ some of it is , \+ some of it actually gets \] into some serious discussions of problems \[ in our , \+ in urban society . \] E_S
108418:56	and then \[ some of it is , \+ some of it actually gets \] into some serious discussions of problems \[ in our , \+ in urban society . \] E_S
108426:69	I guess 0 I do n't really care *-1 to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times . E_S
108426:87	I guess 0 I do n't really care *-1 to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times . E_S
108435:57	um , I do n't like *-1 to listen to it all the time , but , um , some of the time , anyway . E_S
108439:46	but I do n't really care *-1 to listen to it any more for some reason . E_S
108477:52	Well , that 's kind of the way 0 I feel *T*-1 about rock and roll sometimes , too , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
108484:38	you ca n't understand what they 're saying *T*-1 on some of those songs which *T*-2 probably is just as well on some of them , too . E_S
108484:74	you ca n't understand what they 're saying *T*-1 on some of those songs which *T*-2 probably is just as well on some of them , too . E_S
108493:86	but \[ \[ I , \+ I definitely , \] \+ I really \] enjoy the fifties *RNR*-2 , the sixties *RNR*-2 and \[ a lot , \+ some \] of the seventies *RNR*-2 rock and roll E_S
108505:39	You know if it 's informal I 'd probably choose something , I mean , just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that 's a lot of fun , especially this time of year where it 's so nice out *T*-1 . E_S
108515:39	Um , if it was formal I 'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something . E_S
108515:60	Um , if it was formal I 'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something . E_S
108530:15	Then I have some from like church that *T*-1 are more family recipes that *T*-2 are more useful . You know , budget cookbooks , E_S
108562:39	it 's a good reference when you need *-1 to dig something up *T*-2 . E_S
108598:134	the one 0 I had *T*-1 most recently \[ was , \+ was \] one that , \[ was , \+ ha- , \] N_S \[ she , \+ she \] describes *T*-2 as Jim Beard 's favorite , um , summer menu , or something , E_S
108599:70	and it consisted \[ of , \+ of \] grilled kielbasa sausage uh , a potato salad with olive oil , and uh , some tomatoes that *T*-1 had been chopped *-2 up with onions and curry powder
108600:10	and probably some yogurt was in there . E_S
108631:52	I do n't have *-1 to run to the store * to buy or look for something 0 I have n't heard of *T*-2 . E_S
108636:16	That 's why sometimes I shy away from , uh , more of a traditional cookbook *T*-1 E_S
108650:26	\[ We , \+ we \] had some friends over as recently as Saturday night E_S
108669:19	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives \[ and some , \+ and some \] prunes , uh , E_S
108669:40	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives \[ and some , \+ and some \] prunes , uh , E_S
108669:51	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives \[ and some , \+ and some \] prunes , uh , E_S
108669:61	marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives \[ and some , \+ and some \] prunes , uh , E_S
108708:18	Well , there again , sometimes it was easy , E_S
108835:19	The second thing is 0 some colleges only offer the , uh , liberal arts \[ and , \+ \] uh , whereas like State , they offer engineering courses E_S
108843:64	so depending on what your major is *T*-1 , or medical , you might want *-2 to \[ atteck- , some , \+ um , attend somewhere \] like Tech E_S
108843:81	so depending on what your major is *T*-1 , or medical , you might want *-2 to \[ atteck- , some , \+ um , attend somewhere \] like Tech E_S
108849:8	well some schools may even give you financial aid , where another one wo n't *?* *T*-1 . E_S
108853:13	that was something else 0 I had *T*-1 , was , I had government aid , of course , E_S
108932:15	and , uh , something that *T*-1 might play a part is the size of the college . E_S
108974:18	But I guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges \[ might , \+ might \] be a lot different . E_S
108976:74	Um . Oh , \[ I , \+ at State , I \] think 0 *T*-2 it *EXP*-1 's just a waste of somebody 's money * to go there E_S
109030:150	and \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ I think \] 0 that 's really sad , because I think 0 there 's going *-2 to be a generation of kids that *T*-1 are going *-3 to grow up * raised *-4 by somebody else . E_S
109223:36	so , I guess 0 we 're old timers compared to some people . E_S
109291:52	but the trucks that *T*-1 were supposed * to do it , there 's been some problems with *T*-4 from what I 've read *T*-3 in , you know , the mail that we get *T*-2 E_S
109367:12	That 's something 0 \[ we , \+ we \] do n't really make any effort * to , E_S
109887:23	I mean I think 0 sometimes some of \[ the , \+ the \] women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know , E_S
109887:27	I mean I think 0 sometimes some of \[ the , \+ the \] women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know , E_S
109916:69	and , uh , \[ I just , \+ it *EXP*-4 's just \] weird that I was just talking to somebody *ICH*-3 this morning \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] \[ a working , uh , lady , \+ a working mom , \] E_S
109939:36	like just over the weekend I visited my family , and some cousins 0 I had n't seen *T*-1 in a long time , E_S
109948:47	and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes , E_S
109964:96	but I 've really noticed that there are \[ a lot of , \+ uh , a lot more \] people that *T*-1 are more comfortable , at least , with some women being home \[ and , \+ \] at least in the circles 0 I 've travelled *T*-2 and in the church that I go to *T*-3 , you know , E_S
109978:29	I found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work , E_S
110047:14	and that was something 0 we were looking for *T*-1 , um , E_S
110117:58	\[ Ours , \+ um , ours \] barks more \[ than , \+ um , than \] some , because she spent a lot of time at our friends ' house . E_S
110208:21	um , but she might have some contacts here , E_S
110258:159	but *-1 not being a teacher , as you are *?* , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] was not quite as sympathetic \[ as , \+ you know , as \] I probably would have been *?* \[ if , \+ if \] Kay were a teacher or something . E_S
110447:99	\[ \[ If it , \+ if it 's \] \+ if it was \] true there , I 'm sure it 's true with just about probably to some degree every school 0 there is *T*-1 N_S
110541:81	and when it 's cold *T*-1 , I 'm wearing sweat pants , \[ and most of , \+ \] unless I 'm going to something special that my daughter 's doing *T*-2 , or something like that , E_S
110541:111	and when it 's cold *T*-1 , I 'm wearing sweat pants , \[ and most of , \+ \] unless I 'm going to something special that my daughter 's doing *T*-2 , or something like that , E_S
110576:80	\[ and \+ \] I wore dresses all the time because it *EXP*-1 was so much cooler and so much more comfortable * not to have something binding on your waist E_S
110642:83	\[ if we , \+ if we \] had professional jobs where we go into an office and have *-1 to wear a jacket or something *T*-2 that would make a big difference . E_S
110675:25	you 've got *-1 to have something 0 * to add *T*-2 to it or something E_S
110675:54	you 've got *-1 to have something 0 * to add *T*-2 to it or something E_S
110721:11	at least something cooler , N_S
110724:74	because you can ruin your good clothes *-5 getting so hot in them \[ if you \+ \] especially if it 's something that *T*-1 has *-2 to be dry cleaned *-3 , which I do n't have any of *T*-4 . E_S
110734:50	um , even when I go to church *T*-3 I have *-1 to have something 0 I can just throw *T*-4 in the washer when I 'm through *T*-2 . E_S
110737:5	something that it does n't matter if it gets spit up on *-1 , too *T*-2 . E_S
110762:96	Um , I think 0 I 'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] deal with *T*-2 in some quality way . E_S
110814:31	What child *T*-1 's going *-2 to say something 0 some parent 's going *-3 to overreact to *T*-4 E_S
110814:39	What child *T*-1 's going *-2 to say something 0 some parent 's going *-3 to overreact to *T*-4 E_S
110866:79	but * looks to me that it would n't take really that much money * to at least come up with , I mean , some kind of partitions you know , E_S
110871:39	or just * to face the children different directions or to do something E_S
110956:16	but yet she has some every night . E_S
110989:87	I was just in the shower after *-1 finishing \[ * mowing the lawn and , \+ you know , *-2 mowing the lawn and \] removing some old petunias out of the garden , E_S
111072:41	but we 're still fighting bugs , and ready *-1 to change some of \[ the , \+ the \] summer flowers out E_S
111252:75	and \[ he 's , \+ \[ he , \+ he \] \] must be \[ part , \+ cross part \] with some kind of desert animal , because he 's very long and lanky , E_S
111284:61	but we thought , Well , if we ever get another cat , you know , we 'd want something kind of unique , E_S
111342:14	and I had some time off in the afternoon , E_S
111364:15	but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier , bought the dog , E_S
111366:31	and so that night we had a reception for some of the , uh , potential high school students or college students , E_S
111422:43	Uh , I do n't like *-1 to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong E_S
111447:7	so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy 's , because it 's all either McDonald 's or Dairy Queens , E_S
111490:17	Well , what are some of \[ your , \+ your \] favorite inexpensive places *T*-1 ? E_S
111553:19	and when we have something 0 * to celebrate *T*-1 *T*-2 , we head to Houston 's . E_S
111560:47	and they 've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something 0 * to drink *T*-1 *T*-2 , unless you get there at five o'clock , E_S
111589:68	and I 've been *-1 eating at home all week long with the kids and would like *-1 to go out somewhere , E_S
111617:12	You go somewhere else . E_S
111629:100	and , uh , I was thinking about it after I got off the phone , \[ that , \+ that \] I really , you know , wish that there was some way 0 * to , uh , send a message *ICH*-1 to people , you know , about , um , child abuse and things like that *T*-2 E_S
111634:21	those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment . E_S
111642:8	I sometimes have a problem with some of the , especially more famous people who *T*-1 all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork *-2 to say that whatever problems they have *T*-3 , you know , \[ was , \+ was \] because they were \[ abused a- , \+ abused *-4 as \] children . E_S
111642:23	I sometimes have a problem with some of the , especially more famous people who *T*-1 all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork *-2 to say that whatever problems they have *T*-3 , you know , \[ was , \+ was \] because they were \[ abused a- , \+ abused *-4 as \] children . E_S
111648:166	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] I guess 0 before I 'd like *-1 to see that severe of a punishment for it it has *-2 to be \[ a , \+ an \] absolute certainty you know , like , uh , caught *-3 at it , or something E_S
111668:10	well , sometimes they even wonder \[ when , \+ when , \] uh , criminals plead temporary insanity \[ \[ for , \+ for punish- , \] \+ for crimes \] that *T*-1 are so severe and then , you know , they get sent *-2 to a mental institution *T*-3 E_S
111686:75	\[ I think , \+ uh , I think \] 0 if I wanted *-1 to *?* badly enough , I could convince somebody , uh , 0 I was crazy , E_S
111693:117	you know , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-2 's that hard 0 * to do *T*-1 you know , * \[ to , \+ to \] convince somebody that , uh , Gee , you just had no control over what you were doing *T*-3 , E_S
111701:63	well , she looked like my mother who *T*-1 abused me when I was a child *T*-2 , or something , which I think 0 *T*-3 is , unfortunate for that person and yet should n't be an excuse . E_S
111709:41	and I was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused *-1 by the man 0 she loved *T*-2 E_S
111740:139	and , uh , you know , \[ there was , \+ there was , \] nothing on it , E_S which *T*-1 makes me wonder , you know , if it 's as , uh , prevalent \[ as , \+ as \] some of them claim . E_S
111832:69	Um , there 's a little place down on , what is that *T*-1 ? Coit Road , um , Chinese Pavilion or something .
111851:36	They 're really a nice place 0 you could take someone *T*-1 *-2 to eat . E_S
111873:8	and some of those
111880:10	and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend *-1 to want *-2 to go *-3 eat lasagna and garlic bread . E_S
111970:33	\[ That 's , \+ a steak is \] something that I cook *T*-1 at home . You know , \[ tha- , \+ that \] you grill *T*-2 out E_S
111987:14	Anyhow it 's some , N_S
111992:12	it 's some famous steak place over in Addison . E_S
112067:85	\[ when , \+ when \] I go out *T*-1 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] normally * to get , um , some specialty type of food E_S
112082:16	and * save you some money too . E_S
112221:74	I would like *-1 to do that *ICH*-2 \[ as a , \+ as a \] family \[ and , \+ and \] some T V watching . E_S
112367:8	And something major , always needs *-1 to be done *-2 . E_S
112428:33	I have worked \[ in anoth- , \+ at some other \] ones that *T*-1 were not very good in my opinion . E_S
112450:26	What if you had a fire or something with babies ? E_S
112487:15	that 's certainly something 0 we hope 0 *T*-1 never happens . E_S
112573:21	\[ but , \+ but \] some people do n't have a choice . E_S
112580:25	I wish 0 I could find someplace 0 I really felt good about *T*-1 .
112602:41	if they 'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize 0 they 're one short . E_S
112699:15	This is just someplace 0 I 've always wanted *-1 to go *T*-2 E_S
112703:7	and someday I hope we can afford *-1 to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there . E_S
112707:38	and I used *-1 to live in Colorado , oh , sometime ago for a couple of years , E_S
112755:22	I want *-1 to go someplace different up there . E_S
112759:273	Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be 0 * to begin with , uh , money be no object . You know , so just absolutely , you know , first class * fly where I want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 , rent a car if I want *-3 to *?* . Uh , you know , just \[ the , \+ really the \] nicest hotels and stuff like that \[ and \+ and \] not worry if somebody says , well , * let 's take this little side trip , you know , and not have * to sit there and figure out , um , you know , again \[ we , \+ we \] fit that in there or not . E_S
112778:16	To me why somebody would want *-1 to ride around on a boat for a few days *T*-2 is mind boggling . E_S
112828:43	and \[ our , \+ our \] standard excuse for * not going someplace like that is , you know , gee , Holly would starve to death if \[ we , \+ you know , we \] took her into the country E_S
112860:13	And we had some wonderful , wonderful years there under Roger Staubach . E_S
112937:29	And I used *-1 to tease my husband sometimes and say , my gosh \[ yo- , \+ did you \] bet the house or something this week *-2 to get so excited about , these games . E_S
112937:76	And I used *-1 to tease my husband sometimes and say , my gosh \[ yo- , \+ did you \] bet the house or something this week *-2 to get so excited about , these games . E_S
113041:50	And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here *T*-1 , of course , they put together some real cute songs , E_S
113059:15	We drive by some houses *ICH*-2 everyday that *T*-1 have big signs , E_S
113145:5	something like that . E_S
113206:22	I always use it for something 0 I want *T*-1 not something 0 I need *T*-2 . E_S
113206:42	I always use it for something 0 I want *T*-1 not something 0 I need *T*-2 . E_S
113220:93	I think 0 if \[ card \+ cards \] were \[ as , \+ as \] stringent as say \[ a , \+ a \] home mortgage loan or something like that where you have *-1 to , you know , be able *-2 to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills *T*-4 , we probably would n't have the problems 0 we have *T*-3 . E_S
113252:16	when you want something that , N_S
113375:25	And , uh , * seems like some rather large chunks of money could come \[ from , \+ from \] that direction . E_S
113433:64	If they were *-1 to take half of what they spend *T*-3 on that and put it on some economic , you know , \[ inter- , \+ intergovernmental \] or inter United States like programs that one really might *?* . E_S
113438:36	and I do n't mind , uh , *-2 paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to *T*-1 . E_S
113439:32	But \[ I just , \+ I just \] sometimes feel like I 'm being used *-1 . E_S
113539:67	Man \[ our cr- , \+ our , uh , prisons are so crowded \] that , uh , they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set *-1 free within a year to two . E_S
113592:7	So somehow , you know , it does n't really balance out too much . E_S
113691:46	everybody \[ has * to do , \+ has *-1 to do \] something . E_S
113778:11	But \[ some schools , \+ some high schools \] have actually started \[ a program of \+ like a visitation program \] to , uh , you know , \[ areas economically , \+ uh say less advantaged areas . \] E_S
113778:21	But \[ some schools , \+ some high schools \] have actually started \[ a program of \+ like a visitation program \] to , uh , you know , \[ areas economically , \+ uh say less advantaged areas . \] E_S
113785:82	And , uh , \[ they , \+ they \] promote service on the part of the kids \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , some of those people . E_S
113792:88	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ we need *-1 to , \+ we need *-2 to \] try *-3 to figure out some way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] turn that around *T*-4 that everybody , N_S
113837:31	Um , uh , I think 0 there 's some problems , E_S
113840:77	It *EXP*-1 's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that . E_S
114105:8	Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride . E_S
114170:107	uh , E_S because \[ I , \+ I \] need *-1 to have it \[ tuned , \+ you know , tuned *-2 up \] and I do n't know , replace some of the belts . E_S
114192:11	we get some killer winters up here in the mountains . E_S
114251:11	Plus if something goes wrong , I know who * to blame *T*-1 . E_S
114301:36	\[ that was , \+ uh , that was \] something else . E_S
114324:32	so \[ I , \+ I \] do know something about \[ the , \+ you know , the \] really cold weather . E_S
114338:45	\[ and , \+ and \] inevitably as soon as they 're asleep , someone calls on the phone *-1 trying *-2 to sell me something . E_S
114338:79	\[ and , \+ and \] inevitably as soon as they 're asleep , someone calls on the phone *-1 trying *-2 to sell me something . E_S
114348:30	Uh , if I want *-1 to buy something , I 'll take the initiative \[ and , \+ and \] go *-2 find it , you know . E_S

121732:32	I think 0 it needs *-1 to be something , uh , uh , a throwback to where they did a , uh , public execution where it 's visible *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
121736:12	Uh , something , you know , not gruesome E_S \[ but , \+ but \] something more where people know that \[ it , \+ it \] was a deterrent and it was equal for all people *T*-1 . E_S

122007:50	this lady does that to me at work when I 'm taking an order or something *T*-1 , E_S

122158:32	Uh , \[ what , \+ what \] are some of the shows that you have been able *-1 to rent *T*-2 *T*-3 though ? E_S
122214:79	and , uh , just every time 0 I would start *-1 to get into the movie *T*-2 , and it was getting good *T*-2 someone in the crowd would yell , hey , there 's John Red Eagle , you know E_S
122283:78	\[ It was , \+ it was \] kind of like the STAR WARS \[ s- , \+ series , \] you know , just something a little different , yet believable . E_S

122530:23	Well , if you play with some consistency though , you can get it right back down . E_S
122578:21	\[ or , \+ but \] sometimes it all comes together . E_S
122586:7	or something would go wrong E_S
122634:12	That 's some cold golf too , is n't it *?* ? E_S
122678:28	that 's what they do *T*-1 here sometimes . E_S
122775:19	I know 0 maybe some of the big things that , uh , uh , N_S
122803:32	It *EXP*-1 's hard * to consider that something could go on indefinitely . E_S
122806:51	\[ \[ that , \+ that is , \] \+ uh , that is \] something that *T*-1 would be hard 0 * to think about *T*-2 . E_S

122815:81	I would like *-1 to see them , uh , do more in that area 0 *T*-3 to make space travel more , uh , something that the ordinary person can , uh , \[ en- , \+ enjoy *T*-2 . \] E_S
122818:93	\[ I know 0 it 's \+ I think 0 it *EXP*-2 's \] in people 's nature * to be the first 0 *T*-1 to do something . E_S

122843:15	There must be some \[ better so- , \+ better \] way of * doing this . E_S
122849:38	So \[ you , \+ you \] are always looking for something better . E_S
122857:21	I 'm always looking for something better .
122875:46	and , you know , just because they do n't talk about it or something like that . N_S
122886:15	You know , somewhere they can sit down and write down what , you know , things that you 've improved upon *T*-1 , E_S
122967:131	Um , you know , \[ th- , \+ \] or they tack on this , uh , pork bellies \[ and , \+ and \] do things \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 are good for their area *-2 to pass something \[ that *T*-3 is , \+ that *T*-4 is \] not good for the country . E_S
123011:14	but it 's something like , uh , hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest . E_S
123159:9	and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire . E_S
123159:16	and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire . E_S
123167:16	Those big piece of something came *-1 \[ flaming , \+ falling \] out of the roof and landed on the field E_S

123329:13	and there 's some other city . E_S
123345:26	I 'd like *-1 to see some more teams get in . E_S
123411:5	somebody said , you know , 0 you 're either a stranger or a fool *-1 to try *-2 to predict Texas weather , E_S
123453:40	we 're supposed *-1 to have a chance * to get some rain the next couple of days here , uh , which *T*-2 will be , you know , a little bit more typical , uh , autumn weather .
123500:35	So \[ you , \+ you \] all actually had some color , huh ? E_S
123536:42	\[ I was up , \+ I was up \] there cutting some firewood this weekend , E_S
123551:32	Uh , \[ it , \+ there 's \] some trees N_S \[ like the oaks , \+
123556:12	and \[ some of the other oaks . \+ There are a few oaks \] that *T*-1 have lost their leaves . E_S
123583:21	Well we can talk about something else . E_S
123654:51	I do n't know who *T*-1 played when and who *T*-2 does what like some guys are *?* . E_S
123810:25	and maybe we 'll meet up again some time . E_S
123869:77	\[ and \+ so \] it *EXP*-2 was easier * to have a home \[ that *T*-3 did n't \+ exactly that somebody else looks \] out for the maintenance *T*-1 . E_S
123885:5	sometimes I think , um , 0 it *EXP*-1 would be nice * to have a town home , with * not having all that responsibility . E_S
124121:35	but now \[ I , \+ I \] do like some of these , uh , brighter , fluorescent colors . E_S
124152:9	maybe some day
124235:48	my son E_S and I used *-1 to have a bet *ICH*-3 going about some of the players that *T*-2 had moved from here to Minnesota , E_S
124325:33	You know , you like *-1 to have someone like that 0 you could point to *T*-2 say , * see what a fine man , that , he is *T*-3 . E_S
124327:16	You know , some of the , N_S
124372:55	but Nolan I think 0 *T*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ICH*-1 or something , you know , of the game E_S
124387:72	\[ It 's hurting , \+ you know , it 's hurting \] Germany *ICH*-1 , for example , too , and some other parts of Europe \[ where they , \+ where they \] have high industry *T*-2 . E_S
124479:7	and somebody 's come up with a new one that , uh , *T*-1 sort of , N_S
124494:29	That might help a little bit , especially in some places . E_S
124500:8	Now sometimes we get a kind of a , N_S
124521:48	I really think , uh , you know , 0 we 're doing \[ some , \+ some \] important things . E_S
124521:56	I really think , uh , you know , 0 we 're doing \[ some , \+ some \] important things . E_S
124794:18	and then , um , some other credit cards , like store credit cards , you know , I do have them up there a little bit , E_S
124809:9	So , sometimes you have no other choice if you need *-1 to buy something . E_S
124809:45	So , sometimes you have no other choice if you need *-1 to buy something . E_S
124874:31	so that I use *T*-1 , because I travel some . E_S
124889:92	\[ and , \+ and \] if I can get one that *T*-1 'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like \[ that , \+ then that 's \] fine , E_S
125156:25	but \[ that 's always been something \+ that 's been a key factor \] in me , is how reliable is this car going *-1 to be *T*-2 you know . E_S
125339:17	I 've just received some . E_S
125349:56	Um , one thing that *T*-1 has kept our tax burden high , and this will change somewhat in the next few years \[ is the , \+ is the \] level \[ of def- , \+ of the defense \] budget E_S
125380:11	Um , some of the qualifications that I look for *T*-1 was \[ that , \+ \] uh , you know , the cost , and , um , exactly what they did *T*-2 , if it was structured or nonstructured , if they had a little academic , um , uh , in there , and , um , you know , um , you know , what the qualifications of the teachers ' were *T*-3 , and if the place was clean and um , the hours E_S
125395:21	So , um , that 's something that I 'm probably going *-1 to be looking at *T*-2 maybe in the future . E_S
125405:51	But if we do , then I 'm going *-1 to need *-2 to find somebody , E_S
125448:34	and the other ones get up and go *-1 do something else . E_S
125466:7	And sometimes when the child 's a lot younger *T*-1 , \[ before they 're really , \+ um , before three years old , \] you know , like the church is a good program E_S
125467:7	and sometimes you even consider , um , you know , *-1 having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little *T*-2 \[ or \+ or \] something like that , E_S

125518:26	\[ \[ \[ Some , \+ some places , um , start them as early as , I think , \] \+ well , some , \] \+ some places \] take them as infants , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , like eight weeks , even . E_S

125523:79	a friend of mine who *T*-1 's a nurse \[ is , \+ was \] telling about a wonderful new place that *T*-2 opened some place \[ in , \+ on \] Fifteenth Street , E_S
125525:17	it 's in Plano somewhere where , um , E_S
125531:15	you know , some places just specialize in just real little ones E_S
125577:59	Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if \[ he , \+ um , someone invites him \] to lunch , \[ he 'll , \+ he 'll \] not go , E_S
125585:7	and some days he does n't , E_S
125594:7	so somebody sold it in a garage sale , E_S
125616:45	I think 0 you feel better , too , if you get on some program like that , E_S
125631:19	but um , there are some parts during that exercise that I think , I can not do another second of this *T*-1 . E_S
125636:58	I know 0 \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it , \] \+ some of it \] is so tough E_S

125642:18	we take the easy way sometimes . E_S
125795:55	, I mean , I got in eighty-seven , I guess , in like November or something like that , E_S
125819:79	\[ Next , \+ next \] car 0 I get *T*-1 's going *-2 to be a four door *ICH*-3 too . Something with some room . E_S

125889:29	and if it 's going over water or something one of them have *-1 to take the shot for me because I 'm , N_S
125891:58	I 've got where now I can hit it \[ in , \+ in \] the air some of the time *T*-1 . E_S
125907:106	Well , \[ that \+ \] \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 that 's what I need *-1 to do *T*-2 \[ is , \+ is \] * get some kind of lessons or something . E_S

126037:63	You know , I can hit a great drives and think 0 I 'm going *-1 to do all awesome on this hole E_S
126067:22	Um , my sense is that something may just have been done *-1 about it by congressmen MUMBLEx E_S
126069:5	something about the random dialers that *T*-1 just dial phone numbers . E_S
126073:18	I guess 0 in some cases they just consider *-1 pickup \[ your , \+ your \] phone \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not . E_S
126077:29	Um , but I thought 0 I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using E_S
126077:43	Um , but I thought 0 I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using E_S
126086:11	Uh , some of MUMBLEx did too . E_S
126180:11	Uh , some of that unfortunately is legal . E_S
126185:29	but is it a legal , uh , solution for some companies . E_S
126261:26	People must be tired of it or something . E_S
126308:67	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be good for , uh , everyone to do something like that E_S

126329:17	\[ som- , \+ some \] kids are so spoiled nowadays E_S

126335:16	and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes E_S
126357:64	Sometimes I wish 0 we 'd help them out instead of *-1 going all across the world , and helping some countries 0 I never even heard of *T*-2 . E_S

126605:37	well , \[ it 's just \+ it 's \] something that anyone can watch and enjoy *T*-1 . E_S
126736:18	I can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students 0 I see *T*-1 over at the medical school . E_S

127109:19	Of course , if somebody \[ in , \+ in \] China can make something for ten cents and we have *-1 to make it for ten dollars because we have unions , well , I do n't know what *T*-2 's going *-3 to happen then . E_S

127180:32	Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] know some of the people . E_S
127285:23	I 'll be in town or something E_S
127319:33	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] done some water exercises , E_S
127331:34	You do n't go out when it 's twenty some odd degrees *T*-1 , go out to the swimming pool . E_S
127422:26	You know , if I want something intellectual , I usually read a book . E_S
127487:16	not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into *T*-1 . E_S
127567:47	I said Arlington , Texas because the other day , I was talking with somebody E_S and he was in Arlington , Virginia . E_S
127632:40	so \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know some of those shows now , like I used *-1 to *?* . E_S
127723:48	well , \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] your husband could tape it for you sometime . E_S
127759:25	I mean , they 'll have some things *ICH*-1 in there \[ that *T*-2 almost , \+ almost , \] you know , like supernatural , or something , E_S you know ,

127760:15	I mean , somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does *T*-1 E_S
127771:18	it came on after something 0 we used *-1 to watch *T*-2 E_S
127907:10	occasionally , some ice skating will come on , on a Sunday or during the Olympics E_S
127915:26	I like *-1 to catch the gymnastics sometimes , too . E_S
127965:35	so , what I 'm telling you *T*-1 is n't something 0 you go out and do *T*-2 E_S
128011:33	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] sometimes start \[ \[ little , \+ much less , \] \+ much more \] modest efforts , E_S
128081:25	or you do n't have time or something like that . E_S
128082:18	But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning , just like * brushing your teeth you 're going *-1 to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour .
128105:37	\[ It 's a , \+ like it 's \] something 0 you either just really want *-1 to do *T*-2 it E_S or you ca n't talk anyone into *T*-2 it . E_S
128121:65	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] keep *-1 saying 0 if somebody else would do it with me , \[ I , \+ \] \[ that would be , \+ little bit of peer pressure would help \] considerably . E_S
128146:68	I mean , \[ it 's that , \+ it 's that \] kind of like half inch of foam or something . E_S
128165:61	if I do like sit ups , I 'll throw \[ a , \+ a \] towel down or something . You know , E_S
128203:27	and then you go *-1 to read some order book or something E_S
128203:36	and then you go *-1 to read some order book or something E_S
128211:32	Uh , I suppose 0 \[ things , \+ some things \] well happen slowly simply by * having it taught *-1 in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening , * having a new generation *ICH*-3 come up that *T*-2 's more used to it . E_S
128225:85	I think 0 people need *-1 to understand more like what a meter is *T*-3 , instead of how many feet *T*-2 in a meter or something . Just get used to *-4 using all the terms . E_S
128226:8	Because someone says a kilogram , E_S
128234:73	I mean we 're not the kind of society \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] something can be posed *-1 upon *T*-2 , uh , by government will . E_S
128271:12	they have some of those in Ohio . E_S
128343:155	\[ and , \+ \] uh , I guess 0 they 'd have *-1 to consider how expensive the college is *T*-8 and how close to home , if they could handle *-3 being away for real long periods of time or if they need *-4 to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed *-5 to get home *T*-6 *T*-7 . E_S
128369:78	You know , you have *-1 to be a flexible person *-2 to be able *-3 to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you 're used to *T*-4 .
128386:18	you know , is somewhat , N_S
128387:36	\[ if , \+ uh , if \] it 's something different than the one 0 they 're used to *T*-1 , I guess , uh , N_S
128516:35	You know , that I read in \[ PEOPLE or somewhere , \+ no , it was U S A TODAY \] E_S
128574:17	But , did they have some pretty good special effects ? E_S
128602:47	But he directed the one before , uh , I think STAR TREK FOUR , something like that . E_S
128653:11	They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION . E_S
128741:28	what do you feel 0 *T*-1 are some of the main problems ? E_S
128749:19	Uh , in Dallas , some of the major problems , uh , N_S
128837:37	Boy \[ that really , \+ that really \] takes someone who *T*-1 is bold * to do that . E_S
128844:97	Uh , I would say so for the majority \[ \[ in , \+ in our , \] \+ in my \] little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home E_S
128939:20	so it seems wetter or something like that . E_S
129152:27	I 'm going *-1 to look into some other fields . E_S
129155:30	so I think 0 I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of * going to school *T*-1 E_S
129221:61	Which *T*-1 is funny because I got called *-2 last night N_S and the topic was , uh , something about juries . E_S
129288:43	I mean , if he 's going *-1 to be drastic , somebody has *-2 to be drastic back . E_S
129314:124	Well , I guess 0 in cases like \[ that , \+ \] you know , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again *T*-1 I mean , you 've got *-2 to do something . E_S
129334:58	But , you know at the time when the guy kept *-1 saying could you ever convict someone E_S and do you think 0 you 'd ever know beyond a doubt *T*-2 E_S
129337:40	but I ca n't imagine you ever making me that sure of something . E_S
129579:16	Uh , chocolate , something chocolate . E_S
129591:19	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129591:46	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129591:60	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129591:75	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129592:38	One of our favorites is , uh , * to take some , * let 's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think , is that what *T*-1 comes in those little blocks ? And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and , uh , wash them and cool them and then dump them in the , uh , sauce and then take crackers E_S
129607:8	Cake sometimes , E_S
129714:43	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] we 've done that for quite some time , E_S
129744:37	Although \[ just , \+ just \] about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that , uh , *T*-1 work in the library for me said 0 they had n't gotten theirs . E_S
129782:55	I do news , mostly newspapers and , uh , plastic two liter diet Coke bottles . And aluminum cans some , E_S
129820:27	Well , I guess 0 there are some places , uh , in the north , in particular that , uh , *T*-1 have a real definite way of * encouraging you to recycle E_S
129842:12	what are some of the things 0 they do n't recycle *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
129870:41	kind of a pain * to , you know , drive over somewhere special \[ just for that , \+ for two \] little tiny batteries E_S
129875:42	but I think 0 the city one could possibly look into that or something . E_S
129891:53	and one thing 0 I thought 0 *T*-1 was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he , uh , scanned *T*-2 across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff E_S
129975:25	but , I mean , what would somebody do *T*-1 with them . E_S
129987:32	Now , you know , I mean \[ somebody , \+ a \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ serial \] killer or somebody \] goes in and machine guns , you know , \[ fifty , \+ fifty \] children in a school yard , E_S
129987:78	Now , you know , I mean \[ somebody , \+ a \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ serial \] killer or somebody \] goes in and machine guns , you know , \[ fifty , \+ fifty \] children in a school yard , E_S
129993:50	Uh , E_S \[ it 's , \+ you know , it \] seems right sometimes E_S
130023:17	so I think 0 sometimes they 'd prefer *-1 just to get it over with E_S
130030:5	some people , N_S
130036:80	Except that , I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] average cost \[ to si- , \+ to society \] of * having somebody in jail for all their life \[ is , \+ is \] extremely high . I mean , something , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] was amazed at *T*-1 . Uh , uh , per year , E_S
130036:136	Except that , I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] average cost \[ to si- , \+ to society \] of * having somebody in jail for all their life \[ is , \+ is \] extremely high . I mean , something , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] was amazed at *T*-1 . Uh , uh , per year , E_S
130037:16	it *EXP*-1 's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year . * To keep people in jail . E_S
130140:63	I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] movie was made *-1 in , like , nineteen sixty-two or something like that E_S
130539:29	and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and , uh , hung out with them , worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp . E_S
130609:46	Uh , the closest thing 0 I did *T*-1 was * go to some like , uh , restored castles and stuff . E_S
130613:26	\[ That , \+ there \] is some on that west coast of France E_S
130714:32	you probably get charged *-1 like a nickel or something like that . E_S
130762:65	and they 're not reimbursed *-1 by \[ the , \+ the \] people who *T*-2 are over them or something . E_S
130779:94	\[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 really works , uh , at least down here is , \[ if there is , \+ if there is \] \[ some , e- , \+ even some \] money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *T*-4 *T*-5 , you know what I mean *T*-2 , then people tend *-3 to do it .
130779:110	\[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 really works , uh , at least down here is , \[ if there is , \+ if there is \] \[ some , e- , \+ even some \] money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *T*-4 *T*-5 , you know what I mean *T*-2 , then people tend *-3 to do it .
130789:121	but if it 's going *-1 to cost you *-2 to take care of the environment , they 're not quite as , uh likely *-3 to do it as \[ if , \+ uh , if \] you get something back for it . You know . E_S
130800:49	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass *T*-1 on to the consumer , you know ,
130800:69	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass *T*-1 on to the consumer , you know ,
130809:18	if it costs them something , then they 're not as likely *-1 to use it . E_S
130830:108	Uh , another thing 0 I thought of *T*-1 , I guess , 0 *-3 to recycle *T*-2 would be like clothes , because I mean everybody gets rid *-4 of their clothes sometime or other . E_S
130831:73	And one way that we do it sort of \[ in , \+ in \] Iowa *T*-1 is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops . E_S
130841:17	And so that 's something that I 've never , N_S
130846:14	so that 's something that I had n't , you know , looked into *T*-1 before . E_S
130913:40	I 'm getting older and , uh , not sure that 's something 0 I want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
130945:16	Well , we have some very nice \[ hou- , \+ homes \] here in this area . E_S
130983:8	but some of those are pretty big . E_S
131019:41	and , I guess 0 \[ he , \+ he \] did some crazy thing *-1 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away , type of deal . E_S
131019:58	and , I guess 0 \[ he , \+ he \] did some crazy thing *-1 to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away , type of deal . E_S
131026:14	And , so , some were vacant for quite a while before \[ they , \+ you know , they \] finally sold them because there were so many . E_S
131047:67	and , you know , we had originally thought 0 we 'd have *-1 to get a fix up special or something because *-2 being from the northeast we figured 0 we could n't afford anything . E_S
131066:20	And we bought it from someone who *T*-1 was in it , E_S
131113:19	Well , we do to some degree E_S
131238:7	but sometimes , N_S
131302:38	so , uh , it *EXP*-1 would be kind of exciting in some ways * \[ to , \+ to \] see a little bit more of that E_S
131303:7	and some ways , it might be kind of scary . E_S
131332:43	I say Arlington , Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington , Virginia . E_S
131346:16	Well , I learned something already . E_S
131394:29	\[ You \+ you \] should n't be lonesome on a holiday , huh ? E_S
131416:7	and sometimes they want *-1 to do their own thing , E_S
131417:7	so sometimes it 's just spouse and me . E_S
131544:12	Especially in some of these schools around here , I think 0 they have about twenty percent older students . E_S
131550:15	I 've seen some people that *T*-1 are really quite up there you know
131658:35	* Are going *-1 to have *-2 to solve some of the problem , huh . E_S
131740:48	Fact , ever time 0 I 'd start *-1 trying *-2 to correct something *T*-3 , it seemed like the score would \[ go , \+ go \] back up , E_S
131749:29	I probably need *-1 to take \[ some , \+ some \] more lessons , uh , more current \[ and , \+ uh , and \] practice more often . E_S
131749:37	I probably need *-1 to take \[ some , \+ some \] more lessons , uh , more current \[ and , \+ uh , and \] practice more often . E_S
131813:16	and , that 's something 0 my stepfather never could teach me *T*-1 , you know , * just to relax and hit the ball , E_S
131872:16	the one iron is something 0 I 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that \[ I , \+ I \] should pick *T*-2 one up and try *-1 to start . E_S
132012:27	Uh , his name is T Q or something like that . E_S
132013:16	And my notebook is somewhere around here . E_S
132158:17	Well , I watched something on T V *ICH*-1 a couple of months ago by , uh , \[ General , \+ ex , uh , Surgeon General \] Koop . E_S
132170:17	and there 's probably some truth to that . E_S
132236:30	It should n't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that , you know , reasonableness . E_S
132302:20	My husband just turned on something noisy . E_S
132341:43	It *EXP*-1 is a lot more fun *ICH*-3 * to exercise with somebody than is *EXP*-2 is *?* * to do it by yourself . E_S
132413:27	like , * try *-1 to get some place and exercise from five to six , E_S
132424:22	Well , I know , 0 some people go during lunch , E_S
132476:19	It beats memberships at some of these clubs . E_S
132516:85	I still just \[ do n't \+ do n't \] end up *-1 going cause it is n't at a convenient time or I do n't know something , E_S
132517:23	but I need *-1 to do something . E_S \[ If , \+ if \] it 's only * walk the dog or something . E_S
132517:73	but I need *-1 to do something . E_S \[ If , \+ if \] it 's only * walk the dog or something . E_S
132528:18	And if you have somebody who *T*-1 will do it with you , N_S
132547:30	I sure hope 0 they do n't pass something like that . E_S
132621:8	buy something that , you know , N_S more ,
132629:58	one of the best things 0 I heard *T*-1 on taxes * to stimulate the economy , someone , brilliant deductor , probably Lloyd Bentsen , said that all , you know , if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be , you know , spending more money *-2 using their credit cards . E_S
132716:168	and then you just dip the carcass in , uh , boiling water , pull it out , and \[ there 's a , \+ we use a \] little raspy brush , 0 *T*-1 pulls the hair off , and , uh , gut it , and , uh , just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and , uh , some pineapple , about three pineapples , you know , * sliced them up , and , uh , cover him up with , uh , wet , uh , sacks , feed sacks is what I usually use *T*-2 and then start a charcoal fire on top of him . E_S
132716:182	and then you just dip the carcass in , uh , boiling water , pull it out , and \[ there 's a , \+ we use a \] little raspy brush , 0 *T*-1 pulls the hair off , and , uh , gut it , and , uh , just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and , uh , some pineapple , about three pineapples , you know , * sliced them up , and , uh , cover him up with , uh , wet , uh , sacks , feed sacks is what I usually use *T*-2 and then start a charcoal fire on top of him . E_S
132890:80	Oh , well , \[ if you , \+ if you \] had \[ all your , \+ all the \] money in the world or something . N_S
132908:27	Of course I would want one if somebody \[ was \+ was \] given *-1 to me . E_S
132952:6	some of the cars that I got *T*-1 were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors E_S
132952:58	some of the cars that I got *T*-1 were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors E_S
133020:116	I would probably , if I were *-1 to buy a car \[ mys- , \+ \] you know , with the constraints of real money I probably \[ would , \+ would \] go with something \[ like , \+ you know , like \] a Honda Accord . E_S
133032:24	Um , and it really saved us some big money once . E_S
133051:18	usually , you know something breaks , E_S
133056:92	and , uh , at the time 0 we bought it *T*-1 it was like , you know , I do n't know , four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra . E_S
133213:42	you know , you feel like you 're in a boat or something , you know , E_S
133237:15	I talked to someone that * was only a couple of thousand in her town , I think 0 *T*-2 *T*-1 . E_S
133248:14	I certainly have some ideas since I 'm studying it now in college . E_S
133352:8	because sometimes , like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that *T*-1 did n't even learn what , uh , N_S they should *?* *T*-2 *-3 to do the work that she is supposed *-4 to teach *T*-5 , you know . MUMBLEx and according to her plan , E_S
133368:121	so , um , unless we want *-1 to keep *-2 \[ paying , \+ paying \] for these people that *T*-3 ca n't make it in society , we 're going *-4 to have *-5 to do something . E_S
133378:41	But I do think that we have *-1 to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five , six grades and just keep *-2 going over and over and over until most of those that *T*-3 are capable can at least learn *-4 to read and write E_S
133381:52	because they ca n't even get the menial job without *-1 being able *-2 to read something nowadays you know . E_S
133385:93	Uh , \[ you ca n't , \+ you ca n't \] even work an answering machine if you 're at work and had *-1 to get a message or something , you know , or fill out an application * to work at McDonalds if you ca n't read . E_S
133491:12	it 's something that I \[ had n't , \+ had n't \] done *T*-1 before . E_S
133508:12	What are some of the other questions *T*-1 . E_S
133528:66	and he is now in full-blown AIDS , *-1 really not doing very well , and has a brain tumor or \[ some- , \+ that sort of thing . \] E_S
133648:7	Also somewhat MUMBLEx is * to collect owed * to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed *T*-1 . E_S
133683:50	Well , it went pretty well , uh , other than the fact that we encountered some , uh , problems that you run across *T*-1 in older homes with plumbing , which one thing led to another *T*-2 , E_S
133751:17	Well , I expected something to leak , you know
133752:50	left a fitting loose , or did n't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that . E_S
133943:7	and sometimes they 're not very open , E_S
133945:31	I think 0 they 're a little bit biased sometimes . E_S
134028:101	I think 0 they need *-1 to \[ do a little bit , \+ go into a little bit \] more depth , uh , before they would just report , like 0 somebody wants *-2 to make a statement or something like that , E_S
134028:126	I think 0 they need *-1 to \[ do a little bit , \+ go into a little bit \] more depth , uh , before they would just report , like 0 somebody wants *-2 to make a statement or something like that , E_S
134030:15	You know , someone said , Oh , I found a cure . E_S
134034:41	\[ before they , \+ before they \] come out with something like that they need *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] research the matter , I believe 0 *T*-2 , a little bit more . E_S
134185:52	and I think that \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] very surprising 0 some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten *-1 for a lot less money than you would think if you 're willing *-2 to buy ones that *T*-3 are about , the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own *T*-4 E_S
134199:14	Well , certainly some of the top end ones . E_S
134216:92	and I 've tended *-2 \[ to , \+ um , to , \] uh , buy cars that *T*-1 are , you know , two or three , and sometimes even four and five or six years old . E_S
134266:50	Uh , the State of Wisconsin , as a matter of fact , uh , started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution 0 we were getting *T*-1 . E_S
134334:43	maybe to you and I who *T*-1 have grown up \[ in some \+ in , uh , uh , some \] more beautiful parts of the country , uh , I think \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , we become a little more aware *ICH*-2 , uh , rather quickly \[ of , \+ of \] what *T*-3 's happening with air pollution and \[ how , \+ uh , how \] horrible it really is *T*-4 . E_S
134334:65	maybe to you and I who *T*-1 have grown up \[ in some \+ in , uh , uh , some \] more beautiful parts of the country , uh , I think \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , we become a little more aware *ICH*-2 , uh , rather quickly \[ of , \+ of \] what *T*-3 's happening with air pollution and \[ how , \+ uh , how \] horrible it really is *T*-4 . E_S
134341:41	and we 'll let them try *-1 to drink out of some of the lakes and try *-1 to fish in some of the lakes that *T*-2 have been suffering from , uh , the , uh , acid rain E_S
134341:71	and we 'll let them try *-1 to drink out of some of the lakes and try *-1 to fish in some of the lakes that *T*-2 have been suffering from , uh , the , uh , acid rain E_S
134364:43	I think 0 it 's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry \[ of , \+ of \] the Gary area E_S
134392:136	but , I , um , tend to all the , planting the annuals \[ and , \+ and \] the spraying and , um , *-1 taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in , you know , throughout that season , and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and , um , any kind of decorating for the holidays , you know , E_S
134464:48	\[ I think , \+ um , I was thinking \] about *-1 throwing some \[ for , \+ in \] the back , \[ just where the kids , um , \+ \] just way in the back , behind the swing sets E_S
134465:17	or , just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty . E_S
134487:14	and , um , sometimes I 'll help him edge , um , E_S
134508:65	Um , if we had a chance * to move , I think 0 *T*-2 we 'd move back to somewhere that *T*-1 was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required \[ as , \+ as \] far as that goes . E_S
134584:15	we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders . E_S
134584:24	we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders . E_S
134590:24	and , uh , we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries . E_S

134612:30	of course you 're going *-1 to lose some that way E_S
134642:45	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] worked on some of it at T I once upon a time . E_S
134666:29	it 's called *-1 V C X or something like that . E_S

134751:50	\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] something *ICH*-1 definitely that , uh , you know , N_S

134858:11	* Kiss some butt , E_S
134956:30	You can borrow the money * to pay somebody else * to build your house E_S
135180:26	Um , I try *-1 to do some painting , although I 'm not very good at it . E_S
135200:26	\[ I , \+ I \] do some sewing , mostly out of necessity . E_S
135396:12	A jar or something E_S
135476:19	Survival of the fittest or something . E_S
135506:18	now since I got somebody from Arlington , Virginia one day . N_S
135543:19	but , you know , sometimes biogr- , N_S
135546:36	To me , half the time it 's more fascinating than some of these made up stories . E_S
135578:12	it was some time ago . E_S
135579:43	* Seems like it was THE SPY WENT *-1 DANCING , or something like that . E_S
135597:15	* Sounds like something 0 she would write *T*-1 . E_S
135600:54	I think 0 it was by her , now \+ that you mention it , because someone had given it to me , E_S
135618:37	I know , uh , 0 \[ the Bri- , \+ some of the British \] people laugh at us because we 're so enthralled with their royalty . E_S
135700:26	And then * make movies out of some of them . E_S
135716:32	so she could n't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers , E_S
135977:17	and we do \[ some skiing there \+ lot of cross country skiing there . \] E_S
136104:18	I watch CHEERS *ICH*-1 sometimes . And , mostly just movies , when there 's a good movie on *T*-2 . E_S
136115:78	I just like *-1 to have the T V on \[ if , \+ you know , if \] I 'm home alone or something E_S
136166:22	It was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something E_S
136185:24	When I 'm home *T*-1 , sometimes in the day \[ I 'll \+ I 'll \] watch them E_S
136240:21	I think 0 he has some interesting things on it . E_S
136254:14	He 's got some real , N_S
136256:12	there 's some real weird people that , he seems *-1 to come up with *T*-2 . E_S
136266:15	He does have some real bizarre things , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
136311:25	I mean , we still have some highways closed *-1 , E_S
136324:26	and I saw , 0 there were some stop signs , I mean , submerged * up to the writing on the stop sign , E_S
136336:16	So there has been some flooding E_S
136422:44	We 've been getting quite a bit , maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio , E_S
136446:19	but , uh I had something else planned * today , E_S
136514:16	or you been doing some remodeling work on it . E_S
136527:86	Thing is , N_S 0 \[ we 've , \+ uh , the main thing that we 've \] had *T*-1 with this house recently has been some , uh , squirming , I call it * , of the foundation . E_S
136573:14	But , uh , somehow or other that does manage *-1 to , uh , show these little cracks . E_S
136670:15	I mean , some nights it 's just \[ real , \+ real \] quiet . E_S
136703:69	and every day that she 's not at school *T*-1 , uh , she thinks 0 we need *-2 to have someone over and play E_S
136857:61	but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without *-2 doing something . E_S
136865:75	I do n't watch very much of it at all , \[ e- , \+ \] \[ to , \+ to \] the extent that sometimes I feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that
136884:39	They need *-1 to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what *T*-2 's , N_S
136961:12	that 's something 0 * do to *T*-2 , \[
137100:18	Unless I 'm going somewhere warm for the winter . E_S
137117:28	it 's been because of the size or some problem like that . E_S
137264:37	when they do go out *T*-1 , it 's either something 0 my husband can buy the part and fix *T*-2 E_S
137400:29	and , * about had *-1 to be something like that * getting around in a Pinto . E_S
137447:75	Do they still have \[ the , \+ uh , the \] scenic , uh , roadways that *T*-1 cut through the center of some of those trees ? E_S
137680:43	so , now it 's , you know , like a taste of something different . E_S
137751:17	But they 're doing some stomping on Virginia . E_S
137844:8	or somebody that *T*-1 's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership , uh E_S
137848:4	sometimes they do that , E_S
137888:11	Uh , some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north . The C D and the premium sound system . E_S
137914:88	It can raise the car 's center up a little bit . For * going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere . E_S
137927:6	some of these muddy driveways could use it around here . E_S
137940:16	well , you had some there . E_S
138092:75	Uh , overall on campus about twelve hundred , but in the \[ upper school , \+ upper four grades , \] uh , about four hundred and something E_S
138173:59	I think 0 we need *-1 to get back to \[ the , \+ \] * show some respect E_S
138249:36	so I think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree . E_S
138254:43	I think 0 that probably does \[ have , \+ have \] something 0 *T*-1 to do with it , E_S
138279:11	* put some shelves in
138280:21	\[ and , \+ and \] some odd stuff around the house E_S
138285:50	and I do it out of hobby more than , uh , you know , something 0 I have *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
138292:57	Uh , a few years ago , uh , \[ we needed , \+ uh , they needed \] some book shelves E_S
138293:21	and I kind of drew up some simple plans * to make some book shelves E_S
138293:38	and I kind of drew up some simple plans * to make some book shelves E_S
138311:28	but also \[ I , \+ I \] sometimes think that , uh , I enjoy *-1 doing that E_S
138313:30	and , uh , * sounds like you got some real nice tools , too . E_S
138314:39	Do you think 0 you would be able *-1 to do some more if you had more tools and different tools ? E_S
138431:104	\[ I 'd , \+ I 'd \] kind of like *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] look at equipment like a lathe or like you say , a table saw and some of those things that *T*-2 would make , uh , some pretty nice , uh , pieces of , uh , well , wood , \[ for , \+ for \] different things for tables , \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , chairs , for , you know , decks and so forth E_S
138431:138	\[ I 'd , \+ I 'd \] kind of like *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] look at equipment like a lathe or like you say , a table saw and some of those things that *T*-2 would make , uh , some pretty nice , uh , pieces of , uh , well , wood , \[ for , \+ for \] different things for tables , \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , chairs , for , you know , decks and so forth E_S
138438:36	It 's an opportunity * to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel *T*-1 day to day E_S
138458:14	* Probably find someone , N_S
138479:32	I mean I 'm sure 0 there 's some good ones , E_S
138488:37	But \[ I kind of , \+ I \] liked it some ways E_S
138489:7	and some ways I did n't . E_S
138576:47	but I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's hard * to take kids to somebody 0 you do n't know *T*-2 \[ \[ and , \+ or \] \+ \] unless you have awfully good references . Reliable , uh , people , E_S
138608:72	\[ then , \+ then \] on the other hand I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's harder * to stay home in some regards . E_S
138609:52	It *EXP*-1 's hard * to always keep yourself feeling like you 're doing something productive , E_S
138681:129	I think 0 it 's a trend \[ \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's , \] \+ that *T*-1 's , \] uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2 . E_S
138683:22	you have *-1 to have some form of health insurance . E_S
138700:42	we ought *-1 to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that *T*-2 's more fair . E_S
138839:52	and , uh , * turns out 0 it was a prescription . Or people getting somebody else 's blood test . E_S
138843:28	Same sort of problem that *T*-1 happens sometimes is \[ these , \+ some of these , \] uh , like AIDS tests and such . E_S
138843:49	Same sort of problem that *T*-1 happens sometimes is \[ these , \+ some of these , \] uh , like AIDS tests and such . E_S
138852:65	uh , I do n't remember what they call it *T*-1 , sort of like a positive , negatives or \[ some , \+ some \] kind of word 0 they use *T*-2 when \[ a , \+ \] uh , you get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] positive indication of drugs *T*-3 , E_S but \[ there 's not really , \+ there were n't really \] any there *T*-3 . E_S
138852:74	uh , I do n't remember what they call it *T*-1 , sort of like a positive , negatives or \[ some , \+ some \] kind of word 0 they use *T*-2 when \[ a , \+ \] uh , you get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] positive indication of drugs *T*-3 , E_S but \[ there 's not really , \+ there were n't really \] any there *T*-3 . E_S
138952:22	You all , uh , have some , N_S
139013:67	* seems to me 0 I remember that , uh , I was hired *-1 , came in and went through some orientation E_S
139069:41	So here , I know that , uh , last year there was some ice storms while I was out of the state E_S
139083:29	You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like 0 we 've been getting *T*-1 in December , E_S
139083:37	You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like 0 we 've been getting *T*-1 in December , E_S
139219:21	or was that just vacation or something ? E_S
139376:60	Uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] did n't realize that we 'd signed some type of deal like that . E_S
139387:43	* Wonder what *T*-1 happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something . E_S
139408:51	\[ I \+ \] had thought that they had , uh , colonies there , or something . E_S
139643:11	it adds something to the chicken . E_S
139664:18	I could actually find something 0 I could cook *T*-1 real easy that *T*-2 would be \[ kind of \+ sort of \] elegant kind of . E_S
139706:25	and for when I cook pasta or something *T*-1 , I 'll put a little bit of bouillon in there *-2 just to give it a little extra flavor . E_S
139796:37	My folks and I always had a dog and a cat , some , birds , E_S
139812:76	it seems like , we 've always been at a place where we 'd have *-2 to go away for the summer or something *T*-1 E_S
139823:11	Uh , someplace where there , you know , N_S
139825:17	We 've got , some children who *T*-1 would just really , uh , enjoy *-2 having an animal , you know , a dog , I think 0 *T*-3 E_S
139858:44	It was \[ al- , \+ almost \] always at least one cat , sometimes , you know , like fifteen or twenty .
139872:14	we 've got some children E_S
139882:25	You sound like you 've got some small ones in the background . E_S
140022:20	Well , you 've got some experience behind you in the work force . E_S
140070:114	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] was wondering what , if you all were *-2 to get a pet , like if you were *-1 to move into an apartment E_S or a house somewhere ,
140194:15	but my son needed some money , E_S
140243:5	someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school *T*-1 , E_S
140339:20	uh , and then what some people would consider *T*-1 a little more difficult , \[ I , \+ I 'll \] change spark plugs E_S
140362:97	Well *-1 being a female and being alone , \[ you , \+ \] I do n't do anything but 0 *-1 put gasoline , in my car , and let someone else check the oil even . E_S
140397:5	sometimes it makes you wonder . E_S
140489:21	and that 's * find someone and pay them to do it . E_S
140557:84	So what do you think *T*-1 \[ of , \+ of \] * owning a home as opposed \[ to , \+ to \] * renting somebody else 's ? E_S
140559:38	Um , well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in *T*-1 , E_S
140838:74	and when I got \[ my , \+ my \] dogs *T*-1 , \[ when they , \+ when they \] did something *T*-2 I hollered at them and threw them outside . E_S
140884:44	Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside *T*-1 ? E_S
140948:66	and so \[ it , \+ I mean this dog \] really feels like it 's being killed *-1 or something when you try *-2 to , you know , tug on it *-3 to walk it *T*-4 . E_S
140959:72	You know , maybe \[ you nee- , \+ you can get \] it signed *-1 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes . E_S
140962:42	Well , \[ we 've heard bad , \+ we 've heard some bad \] things about some of those , you know , E_S
140962:56	Well , \[ we 've heard bad , \+ we 've heard some bad \] things about some of those , you know , E_S
140963:8	they sometimes \[ mis- , \+ misuse \] their license or whatever you know , E_S
141005:21	unless they get used to something , they 're really nervous E_S
141015:32	and , uh , if they 're not accustomed to something , \[ they , \+ they 're \] really scared . E_S
141060:12	and my husband sometimes joins them with that . E_S
141065:17	and I 'll take some time and do that with her . E_S
141067:30	and even \[ the , \+ the \] older kids sometimes sit down \[ and , \+ and \] will join in and listen to a story . E_S
141108:13	and * spend some time with him . E_S
141148:33	and then they 'll get *-3 to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get *-1 to pick *T*-2 out E_S
141203:39	and we 're you know , thinking about *-1 having children sometime in the next couple of years E_S
141331:7	and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat . E_S
141347:14	or , uh , sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon . E_S
141431:40	There is one cousin out in Colorado , uh , uh , some cousins over in Phoenix , uh , E_S
141450:9	and , somebody brings the volleyball net , E_S
141451:5	somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon E_S
141464:30	I married your cousin 's brother 's uncle or something like that . E_S
141656:9	Always something 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
141786:8	I sometimes watch T V if I , N_S
141805:114	And then \[ I , \+ I \] figure 0 if there 's \[ big , \+ big \] news , I 'll hear it from my husband *ICH*-2 when he gets home *T*-1 or , someone else , you know . E_S
141885:22	I 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something , E_S
141885:50	I 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something , E_S
141897:15	Well , uh , sometimes it 's such a , N_S you know ,
141914:8	I sometimes feel like , um , the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS , um , the top headlines are always a murder , you know . E_S
142030:25	You know , I mean , some topics , N_S
142052:37	well , it seems like , I do n't know , some things are sensationalized *-1
142053:7	or some things are , um , E_S you know ,
142064:55	And , uh , I also like *-1 to plant flowers and \[ do \+ do \] some gardening and do arts and crafts . E_S
142090:10	No , sometimes we ride E_S
142091:7	and sometimes , uh , we , pull , E_S
142227:9	\[ some , \+ uh , you know , I have some \] good shots and some bad shots . E_S
142227:39	\[ some , \+ uh , you know , I have some \] good shots and some bad shots . E_S
142227:51	\[ some , \+ uh , you know , I have some \] good shots and some bad shots . E_S
142230:55	\[ It , \+ it *EXP*-1 \] is just nice * to get outdoors and do something . E_S
142261:71	and I even had , uh , I guess 0 it was *RNR*-1 last year or the year before , I had some out E_S
142285:15	I have got some of those too , E_S
142291:42	And \[ I do , \+ I try *-1 to do \] some arts and crafts E_S
142303:50	\[ I , \+ uh like you , I \] have n't done any in quite some time except for what I call *T*-1 living now \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is \] very close to * camping . E_S
142319:36	and , you know , my dad and I went out sometimes E_S
142418:201	But , uh , you know , right now , uh , what we did *T*-1 , my wife and I , is 0 we got a mobile home . One of these twelve by forty-eight 's that *T*-2 got repoed *-3 , And , uh , swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring 0 I would build a house some day , you know . E_S
142540:13	have you painted something lately ? E_S
142579:22	Now , I asked Janice , or somebody recently how you do that *T*-6 uh , when you paint the ceilings *T*-5 you know where you have got that textured stuff , that they have special rollers that *T*-1 are real soft and furry that you paint *T*-3 that with *T*-2 *T*-4 . E_S
142623:54	So , I am thinking 0 I am going *-1 to change it to , uh , something , you know , E_S
142628:36	I think 0 I am going *-1 to put something like a brown on it , on the outside . And maybe , a little deeper brown *ICH*-2 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little .
142628:102	I think 0 I am going *-1 to put something like a brown on it , on the outside . And maybe , a little deeper brown *ICH*-2 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little .
142642:12	There are some columns that *T*-1 could be painted *-2 *-3 a different color too . E_S
142751:86	But then that way you know you are assured 0 you did a good job than you are *?* , you know , if you hire someone 0 *T*-1 to do it . E_S
142769:15	Like thirteen bucks or something . E_S
142791:56	and when he got outside *T*-1 , he noticed 0 his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something . E_S
142923:70	As far as the Rangers are concerned *-1 , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 they \[ need some , \+ definitely need some \] pitching . E_S
142923:84	As far as the Rangers are concerned *-1 , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 they \[ need some , \+ definitely need some \] pitching . E_S
142973:64	and I think 0 you 're probably right , \[ that they , \+ that they \] need \[ some , \+ you know , some \] changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe E_S
142973:83	and I think 0 you 're probably right , \[ that they , \+ that they \] need \[ some , \+ you know , some \] changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe E_S
142994:25	They need *-1 to have \[ some , \+ some \] young guys that *T*-2 can take the lead E_S
142994:34	They need *-1 to have \[ some , \+ some \] young guys that *T*-2 can take the lead E_S
143109:20	actually now you can get some really good deals *-1 flying over , E_S
143137:40	You know , I 'd like *-1 to go to Hawaii some time , E_S
143198:38	Well , you 'll just have *-1 to plan a vacation some time \[ and , \+ and \] go over there . E_S
143327:28	It sounds like we 've been to some of the same places . E_S
143360:32	Right now we 're looking for housing , uh , somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area . E_S
143415:60	so , we 're looking forward to *-1 retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere . \[ Closer , \+ closer \] to our families . E_S
143470:60	Oh , I do n't think 0 it 's possible unless you , you know , multimillionaire , something like that . E_S
143489:21	actually , if we find something for , uh , I 'd say *RNR*-1 less than a hundred and twenty thousand , we 'll be doing all right , you know . E_S
143505:74	Lot of people \[ will buy , \+ in your situation will buy \] a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something \[ or the , \+ or do \] something . E_S
143505:99	Lot of people \[ will buy , \+ in your situation will buy \] a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something \[ or the , \+ or do \] something . E_S
143645:21	And there are , uh , some fairly sophisticated approaches that *T*-1 are used *-2 in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people , uh , gain a competence with respect to the material . E_S
143680:38	you must see kids with real significant problems , uh , in some cases . E_S
143790:82	and we just keep a \[ few \+ you know , few \] of the major ones , and then use them once in a while for something , E_S
143814:17	But I know 0 some people can \[ get , \+ get , \] you know , carried *-1 away with them and let them get out of hand . E_S
143820:41	I try *-1 to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill 's going *-2 to come *T*-3 , E_S
143821:7	but sometimes I forget E_S
143835:16	It seems that some of them have gotten higher E_S
143841:42	I do n't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or \[ some , \+ some \] other state 0 *T*-1 had a Visa card that *T*-2 was the lowest one in the country . E_S
143841:50	I do n't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or \[ some , \+ some \] other state 0 *T*-1 had a Visa card that *T*-2 was the lowest one in the country . E_S
143847:31	and I think 0 it 's eighteen percent or something E_S
143851:36	so , * think 0 I want *-1 to find something that *T*-2 has a lower rate . E_S
143879:47	For the amount that I charge *T*-1 , I get two dollars back or something E_S
143936:15	I 've got some that \[ I , \+ you know , I \] have n't even used *T*-1 at all , uh , past few years E_S
143997:149	I think 0 \[ \[ if it 's , \+ uh , if it 's a con- , \] \+ if it 's a convicted , \] uh , felon on parole uh , and he goes out \[ and , \+ and \] commits another crime or kills somebody , \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I \] feel the same way , E_S
144008:26	But , I do know that \[ some people , \+ almost all people \] usually die before that point . E_S
144081:37	because \[ I , \+ you know , if \] somebody has been convicted *-1 and has been sentenced *-1 *-1 to be put *-2 to death , how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of \[ ex- , \+ execution *T*-3 ? \] E_S
144096:32	Well , \[ th- , \+ there \] were some people \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 had a problem with that . Because they found out later on that , jeez , you know , a guy will lie rather than get killed *-2 . E_S
144107:36	\[ And , \+ uh , or \] he 'll have somebody lie for him . E_S
144139:32	You know , and they convicted this guy because somebody says , well , he looks like the right guy . E_S
144194:46	I think 0 \[ by , \+ uh , by \] * relieving some of the pressure off \[ of , \+ uh , of , \] uh , uh , N_S
144226:38	\[ and \+ and , \] they made a heck of a threesome E_S
144304:16	so it 's not something 0 you 'd drive *T*-1 , E_S
144340:12	You get somebody like Magic E_S
144374:27	Well , uh , uh , that 's something 0 I 've thought a lot about *T*-1 . E_S
144387:223	Uh , when they asked us \[ did , \+ did \] we want *-7 to , uh , keep it the same or , uh , spend more , spend less *T*-1 , \[ I think \+ uh , I think \] 0 right now what they 're spending *T*-2 is adequate . Uh , \[ my , \+ for my \] personal opinion . Uh , because I think 0 it 's something that *T*-3 's going *-4 to take them a while 0 *-6 to come up with a , uh , vaccine for *T*-5 . E_S
144421:17	Uh , that 's something 0 I 've never really kept up with *T*-1 at all . E_S
144517:14	But it 's something 0 you got *-1 to think about *T*-2 these days . E_S
144544:40	But , uh , uh , I know that , uh , in some of these larger cities they 're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing \[ * to prevent , \+ \] you know , so that , uh , the drug addicts wo n't be getting dirty needles and everything . E_S
144599:9	well someone who *T*-1 's not ready *-2 to give up drugs , uh , You know . E_S
144614:100	You know , I guess 0 if you consider the two problems , drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have *-1 to come first , I guess , as far as something 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] do *T*-2 about it . E_S
144705:77	a lot of \[ the , \+ my \] family , you know , they fear me working like that and , under \[ some , \+ some \] of those conditions , E_S
144705:86	a lot of \[ the , \+ my \] family , you know , they fear me working like that and , under \[ some , \+ some \] of those conditions , E_S
144729:65	Uh , one evening I decided *-1 to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought , oh , well , something 's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams E_S
144830:23	Uh , I never thought about someone robbing those , E_S
144833:51	I do n't know , uh , how a few bucks can be worth * shooting somebody *T*-1 E_S
144867:217	and \[ I think 0 people , \+ uh , I think 0 when you \] have haves and have nots *T*-6 , you 're always going *-1 to find people that *T*-2 are too lazy *-3 to figure a way 0 * to earn money *T*-7 and find 0 it *EXP*-8 's easier *ICH*-9 if you can get a gun * to go out and hold something up than it *EXP*-5 is *?* * to figure out a way 0 * to legitimately earn the money *T*-4 . E_S
144928:25	it 's , uh , a little scary sometimes E_S
144978:62	every once in a while you read in the newspaper *RNR*-3 or you 'll see it on T V or something *RNR*-3 where the discussion comes out that , you know , women are paid *-1 less than men *T*-2 E_S
145004:14	And you hear some people say , you know , N_S well , he 's a man , E_S
145249:31	She 'll have *-1 to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year E_S
145350:46	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] know pe- , \+ I know some other people \] that *T*-1 have done that . E_S

145407:10	uh , sometimes I wish 0 I had them , E_S
145433:60	even with my gas card you know , I find that I 'll go in *-1 to get some gas E_S
145456:31	I mean , there are \[ sort \+ some \] inherent limits there , E_S
145538:67	\[ I , \+ in fact , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] \] even , uh , heard some people that *T*-1 have applied for credit cards with much less , uh rates and have paid off their , you know higher interest rate , uh cards and just sent them back , you know . E_S
145554:43	And \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ there 's some , \+ there 's , uh , uh , some \] negotiating there , too , E_S
145554:69	And \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ there 's some , \+ there 's , uh , uh , some \] negotiating there , too , E_S
145556:37	on one of the local talk shows here , they had somebody on \[ and , \+ and \] said , what you can do *T*-1 is , uh , * call , you know , E_S
145558:23	or I 'll just go to somewhere else . E_S
145595:18	and I 'll go somewhere else and get it . E_S
145620:37	and then they just meet at , like , a park or something *-1 to have like \[ \[ a , \+ a \] short , \+ uh , or a small , \] uh , dinner type thing . E_S
145627:21	\[ and , \+ and \] sometimes we 've gone E_S
145648:50	And then they just sort of do like a little program or , you know , something like that so that everyone 's sort of involved *-1 . E_S
145693:13	and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn E_S
145694:20	and , uh , they had some activity , E_S
145699:58	Now next time 0 we have one *T*-1 , E_S we 'll have *-1 to think of something more creative 0 *-3 to do *T*-2 . E_S
145704:5	someone 's been born *-1
145705:7	or someone passed away
145706:20	or , you know , something like that E_S
145725:23	Uh , I found \[ out some , \+ about some \] of the relatives
145725:35	Uh , I found \[ out some , \+ about some \] of the relatives
145726:75	\[ \[ I did n't , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I \] did n't even know their names , some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles E_S

145745:37	My grandmother 's , uh , sister who *T*-1 would be somewhere \[ in , \+ in \] West Virginia . E_S
145770:21	* Let me ask you something ,
145893:39	\[ and \+ and \] we pay the same amount that someone over there that *T*-1 has four children has *T*-2 , I mean , E_S
145920:28	because I looked into *-1 picking up some , uh , medical insurance \[ for my , \+ just for my \] family , you know , \[ just , \+ \] N_S
145948:130	I guess 0 \[ what , \+ \] the other benefits \[ \[ that , \+ uh , that I , \] \+ uh , that I \] miss *T*-1 , I guess is , uh , you know , some of the bonuses and stuff \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 goes on with just * being involved *-3 with a big company , you know E_S
146047:31	\[ I \+ mean , I \] know someone out here that *T*-1 makes eighteen dollars an hour . E_S
146094:19	Um , I 've done some cross stitching . E_S
146104:5	somehow I do n't have the time anymore . E_S
146105:130	But I have all these friends that wherever you go *T*-1 , \[ they , \+ *T*-2 they \] sit down and the next thing 0 you know *T*-3 , *T*-2 they pull out of their , uh , bags \[ some , \+ \] their most recent , uh , needle craft E_S
146125:56	and I just do n't have the patience 0 * to just , you know , do something *T*-1 . E_S
146202:136	Well , one thing that I like *T*-1 about this fabric painting thing is 0 I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then , um , cut out a little pattern *ICH*-2 \[ from the material , \+ from some material , \] like flowers or something , and make , um , a design or , you know , a little arrangement or something on the shirt and , you know , fuse it on with Heat and Bond , or whatever and then paint around it .

E_S
146229:41	So \[ I had , \+ I went \] and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back E_S
146245:5	someone told me \[ \[ that , \+ that it , \] \+ that they \] had done it both ways , E_S
146345:75	because \[ he , \+ he \] thinks 0 the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one is n't *?* or something , E_S
146425:15	on the set or something . E_S
146446:16	there 's \[ something 0 I watch *T*-2 , \+ something 0 I watch *T*-1 \] on Saturdays , E_S
146446:39	there 's \[ something 0 I watch *T*-2 , \+ something 0 I watch *T*-1 \] on Saturdays , E_S
146455:34	I 've heard of , N_S a lot of people somehow or something . N_S
146455:39	I 've heard of , N_S a lot of people somehow or something . N_S
146456:37	They 'll say , so and so from TWIN PEAKS , or something , you know . E_S
146521:32	And how do you feel *T*-1 about * putting someone in the nursing home ? E_S
146524:183	\[ I , \+ I \] believe , if I , am in a position , uh , like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care *T*-1 *T*-2 that I will be able *-4 to just bring her *ICH*-3 into my home and my father also , \[ and \+ uh , or \] have someone go into their home , you know \[ and \+ uh , and \] look \[ after \+ \] them . E_S
146541:85	And it is like they feel , \[ 0 they are , \+ \] uh , the way 0 my mother would put it *T*-1 like somebody had thrown them away . You know ? E_S
146546:25	I do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone . In a place like that , uh , you know , aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *T*-3 is offered *-5 and such E_S
146546:103	I do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone . In a place like that , uh , you know , aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *T*-3 is offered *-5 and such E_S
146578:9	\[ some , \+ some \] of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] people that *T*-1 are in there are \[ real , \+ you know , very \] nice and friendly to everybody E_S
146578:18	\[ some , \+ some \] of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] people that *T*-1 are in there are \[ real , \+ you know , very \] nice and friendly to everybody E_S
146596:83	I think 0 it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts *T*-1 . Because there are some , uh , who *T*-2 poor things , you know , do n't have , uh , any real grasp on reality any longer . E_S
146614:76	Well , it is like , \[ wel- , \+ \] the one that I worked in *T*-1 , uh , you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day , E_S
146620:33	and then you would \[ see \+ see \] some of the others that *T*-1 \[ are \+ were \] like distant from the other group E_S
146621:53	and they they just did n't like participate together with the others because they had \[ some \+ some , \] uh , I guess , uh , slight mental disabilities and things like that . E_S
146621:60	and they they just did n't like participate together with the others because they had \[ some \+ some , \] uh , I guess , uh , slight mental disabilities and things like that . E_S
146645:54	I think 0 if we wait *ICH*-3 , uh , which *T*-1 is happening until somebody says 0 we have *-2 to do it it is going *-4 to be to late . E_S
146663:14	and there are some fire stations 0 I can take newspapers to *T*-1 E_S
146711:46	And I think 0 it is going *-1 to come to that because some people will just not go to the , N_S
146767:23	Well , \[ on- , \+ some \] of them are five ,
146768:5	some are ten cents . E_S
146830:12	you see some of the stuff E_S
146842:82	And , uh , I just look at it , 0 I do n't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why did n't you do something *T*-1 . E_S
146883:11	You buy some E_S
146901:16	Because I had some appointments at the office *ICH*-1 today , some interviews E_S
146901:37	Because I had some appointments at the office *ICH*-1 today , some interviews E_S
146950:25	So *-1 to be taller than some of the boys in the \[ bigger grades , \+ uh , older grades , \] I had *-1 to wear heels . E_S
147027:16	We 're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we 're so used to *-1 running around like that . E_S
147058:50	it does n't matter if I have *-1 to wash it a hundred times or something . E_S
147069:16	I know that some of the schools they have , uh , country western day or something like that one , you know , or tacky day , E_S
147069:51	I know that some of the schools they have , uh , country western day or something like that one , you know , or tacky day , E_S
147085:37	Um , oh , \[ it , \+ there 's \] some good things about it E_S
147159:16	I think 0 something *ICH*-2 too that you probably see *T*-3 in older states , all \[ we , \+ we \] do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces *T*-1 . E_S
147191:49	We can \[ drive into , \+ when we 've been on vacation or something *T*-1 drive into \] Fort Worth or Dallas E_S
147239:53	but I think , uh , 0 we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to make some fundamental changes E_S
147245:36	And it 's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car , just one person in that *T*-1 . E_S
147280:11	but with somebody that *T*-1 needs around the clock care , N_S
147292:13	and they needed some quality care , E_S
147293:14	I would put someone in a nursing home . E_S
147328:24	and I have thought 0 if something would happen to my mother for , uh , N_S
147338:27	I am sure 0 you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas . E_S
147341:8	And some of them are limited care *ICH*-2 too where people can do , uh , N_S
147436:19	but \[ it , \+ something \] will have *-1 to change as more and more of us get older . E_S
147478:44	So , \[ I , \+ you know , you \] pick up some traits from her and stuff . E_S
147503:27	I hope 0 that happens to me someday . E_S
147583:29	And it *EXP*-1 's just too bad that some people , you know , still look down on them just because of their color . You know . E_S
147615:5	some people say oh the boys should n't have *-1 to do those jobs . The inside jobs . E_S
147697:28	But I wish 0 they would get some more on that . E_S
147736:14	I had read something one time E_S
147755:52	and personally I feel 0 \[ it 's probably , \+ there 's probably \] some of each . E_S
147825:18	we 're talking about somebody 's personal life E_S
147829:43	and it almost seems like in order *-1 to avoid , uh , some of the scandal , you would have *-1 to have the kind of wife that you would only find *T*-2 , \[ on , \+ say in \] the Bobsy twins or , something like that . E_S
147829:143	and it almost seems like in order *-1 to avoid , uh , some of the scandal , you would have *-1 to have the kind of wife that you would only find *T*-2 , \[ on , \+ say in \] the Bobsy twins or , something like that . E_S
147885:34	the Japanese government is always having \[ a , \+ some \] kind of a scandal . E_S
147896:37	I still believe 0 I get very fed up with government sometimes E_S
147922:86	Oh , well , I guess 0 I like a wide range . Uh , everything \[ from , \+ uh , from \] Baroque through at least some modern music . E_S
147965:93	In fact , they even do that for operas \[ sung , \+ sung * \] in English , because it *EXP*-1 is hard * to understand the words sometimes . E_S
148038:32	ca n't you get records *ICH*-1 through that or something , recordings ? E_S
148133:33	Uh , I suppose 0 that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth , because I do get things from ski associations and things , uh , \[ at , \+ during \] the year . E_S
148143:35	more likely *-1 to see those at a ski show or something , E_S
148187:41	I 'd like *-1 to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those . E_S
148204:16	and then we have some church magazines , E_S
148235:33	but then eventually there 'll be a school project or something where my son will need *-1 to refer back through forty-eight back issues *-3 to find you know , France or something or whatever *ICH*-6 it is *T*-2 0 he 's looking for *T*-5 *T*-4 . E_S

148360:9	Even some of that I like *T*-1 okay but not , mostly , as a general rule , E_S
148377:14	and I like some of their songs . E_S
148445:20	What about the blues or something like that ? E_S
148462:27	\[ I , \+ I \] like some of it , um , E_S
148469:11	Um , some of it sounds more like pop music . E_S
148536:16	Um , I have some Spiro Gyro tapes . E_S
148545:11	I have some dulcimer music . E_S
148552:19	Al Jarreau , he 's somebody 0 I like *T*-1 . E_S
148568:15	I mean , some people sing , E_S
148569:43	and they have their faced all contorted , like it hurts them or something . E_S
148594:37	I think 0 it was like five of them or something E_S
148602:5	something like that , E_S
148625:27	I would like *-1 to learn that someday , E_S
148673:44	and tole painting is just \[ a , \+ \] you know , something 0 I do *T*-1 in my spare time E_S
148897:37	* Got \[ that , \+ \] uh , uh , some insight *ICH*-2 there , 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to \] kind of help me put together the feelings . E_S
148990:90	I vaguely remember 0 \[ \[ we , \+ um , we had a , \] \+ we had a , \] um , spy ship torpedoed *-1 or something . E_S
148999:12	Is n't that something ? E_S
149155:55	You know , when you write a test *T*-1 you have *-2 to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing *T*-3 and find out which ones *T*-4 are discriminating well and which ones *T*-5 are n't *?* find out how reliable the test is *T*-6 , E_S
149169:21	Well , I was doing some of the same stuff , but doing it more slowly , and with smaller files . E_S
149231:71	Oh , we spend a lot of time outdoors *-1 jogging , bicycling , uh , going to the park , um , some time *-1 watching V C R movies um ,
149249:6	some of the things 0 we do *T*-1 together as a family , we like *-2 to play games a lot , E_S
149297:15	So you have some in the nest and some out , huh . E_S
149297:29	So you have some in the nest and some out , huh . E_S
149326:31	and then if you want *-1 to play something on the little kids ' level , then the older kids get real bored , E_S
149327:24	and they want *-1 to do something else . E_S
149353:7	and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house E_S
149383:120	I think 0 a lot of people are panicked *-1 , how kids are turning out *T*-4 and how things are going for kids *T*-5 and realizing 0 they 've got *-2 to start *-3 doing something . E_S
149432:17	Oh , I have some relatives out there in Texas , E_S
149502:68	\[ he 's , \+ uh , he has \] been really aggressive , uh , especially towards my little girl , for some reason . E_S
149559:35	You would n't want him to carry her off or something . E_S
149583:38	and we ended up with , uh , oh , malamute and some other kind of mix . E_S
149615:22	you know , I saw something *ICH*-3 on C N N or on cable here a while ago that *T*-2 showed some people that *T*-1 had rabbits in apartments and in houses , E_S

149629:41	And do \[ they , \+ they \] just paper train it or something ? E_S
149661:22	and that 's really kind of something 0 * to watch *T*-1 , uh , E_S
149669:8	and some of the weirdest animals 0 you ever want *-1 to see *T*-2 in there . E_S
149727:73	and especially in this election year , I think that , uh , there ought *-1 to be \[ so- , \+ at least some \] conversation about what we are supposed *-2 to do *T*-3 about this . E_S
149755:23	hell you can buy a coke or something for that . E_S
149771:92	especially the Democratic candidates do n't seem *-1 to be coming up with much that *T*-2 really sparks my interest as far as yeah , maybe that could do something 0 *T*-3 to affect our budget at this point . E_S
149815:32	I mean , if they could actually put something together and make , N_S
149820:43	but with this peace dividend , it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had *?* in the thirties , or whatever . E_S
149911:186	um , what *T*-1 really bothers me is 0 it just seems like \[ if , \+ if \] anyone were *-2 to say , you know , well I 'm going *-3 to raise taxes and cut the budget and \[ we 're \+ MUMBLEx , we 're \] going *-4 to have *-5 to do some unpopular things , I mean , he would n't have a chance of * getting elected *-6 . E_S
149978:23	and , uh , they 've had some impact , but not a tremendous amount , E_S
149990:22	You know , particularly in some of the housing projects , uh , you know , \[ that 's , \+ that \] tends *-1 to be where a lot of that crime is focused *-2 *T*-3 E_S
150133:52	\[ I 've actually , \+ I 've \] \[ known , \+ known \] some people that *T*-1 have had their cars stolen *-2 . E_S
150146:7	and some superficial type damage , E_S
150248:40	and the , uh , microwave had *-1 to have , uh , some kind of something 0 I ca n't even pronounce *T*-2 , E_S
150248:49	and the , uh , microwave had *-1 to have , uh , some kind of something 0 I ca n't even pronounce *T*-2 , E_S
150336:17	Well , that 's something 0 I 've never had *-1 to use *T*-2 , E_S
150412:22	they usually sign a contract or something E_S
150424:58	Uh , if you 've been going to a doctor for , you know , ten years or something and he elects *-1 not to join , it can be very stressful for you know , those people . E_S
150447:110	but if you , you know , have a family \[ and , \+ and , \] um , everybody 's gone to different doctors , uh , it *EXP*-2 is hard * to give up somebody who you feel 0 *T*-1 knows you and your body and \[ your , \+ \] just has , you know , all the medical history E_S
150517:124	I would think that that type of employment , \[ \[ you 're , \+ you 're , \] \+ one day you might be \] really tuned in and the next day , oh , a little luke warm or something E_S
150786:21	While I 'm at work sometimes , \[ I , \+ \] on the computer network um , I read the news sometimes , E_S
150786:67	While I 'm at work sometimes , \[ I , \+ \] on the computer network um , I read the news sometimes , E_S
150857:118	\[ you , \+ you \] just ca n't get a full picture of , you know their message unless you have time 0 * to sit down \[ and r- , \+ and probably read \] something on it *T*-1 . E_S
150893:35	or if I , you know , am interested in something ,
150903:60	If they put it out in a video , or on , not a video but a cassette tape or something , where you could just listen to it *T*-1 I would do that while I was doing other things . E_S
150938:25	it 's like sixteen hundred days or something . E_S
150976:42	if you wanted *-1 to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it E_S
150979:122	I think that , uh , one , uh , advantage of * having , uh , the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want *-1 to make * sure that you do n't , uh , convict someone who , uh , *T*-3 really should n't be convicted *-2 . E_S
150984:71	I guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *T*-1 is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who *T*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4 . E_S
150984:144	I guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *T*-1 is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who *T*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4 . E_S
151063:96	Yeah , I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ I \] really , \+ I would like \] *-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] do at some point , um , E_S
151066:23	but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well . E_S
151089:5	someone had *-1 to figure out what *T*-2 was going on ? E_S
151107:21	The one thing 0 I sometimes wonder about *T*-1 , um , in civil cases is , uh , whether , especially sort of in , uh , maybe like \[ pro- , \+ product \] liability , or medical malpractice , where there 's , um , sort of a very technical decision 0 *T*-2 to be made *-3 sometimes *T*-4 N_S
151107:175	The one thing 0 I sometimes wonder about *T*-1 , um , in civil cases is , uh , whether , especially sort of in , uh , maybe like \[ pro- , \+ product \] liability , or medical malpractice , where there 's , um , sort of a very technical decision 0 *T*-2 to be made *-3 sometimes *T*-4 N_S
151113:46	it 's sort of a matter of , um , you know , * sometimes getting into very technical issues , E_S
151118:86	\[ In , \+ in \] the case 0 you were involved in *T*-1 , you said 0 it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind . E_S
151208:126	and then , it was always exciting when we got called *-1 *-4 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] go *T*-2 , because then we thought 0 we might be able *-3 to do something else besides , uh , * just sit in the jury room . E_S
151317:24	But , uh , apparently for \[ some , \+ some \] crimes , it *EXP*-1 's permissible * to have six people sit in judgment . E_S
151317:32	But , uh , apparently for \[ some , \+ some \] crimes , it *EXP*-1 's permissible * to have six people sit in judgment . E_S
151348:25	it was *?* , yeah , in some of the critical things , like \[ the off- , \+ special investigations , \] at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person , E_S
151349:7	but something happened to the camera and the tape and N_S
151377:38	But , uh , \[ they , \+ they \] have done some testing around our office , mostly after lunch , *-1 looking for people \[ drinking , \+ uh , drinking \] beer and stuff at lunch time , E_S
151453:28	\[ and \+ and \] the policy is something like , * see if I can \[ re- , \+ state \] this correctly now . If you turn yourself in as *-1 having a drug related problem , then you 're eligible for company counseling . E_S
151543:30	Well , you know , you can take some of \[ that , \+ that \] testing a little bit too far . E_S
151557:37	I think 0 it *EXP*-2 's a severe invasion of somebody 's privacy * to say , well , we 're going *-1 to look at your urine and then decide whether you 're , uh , you know , worthy of *-3 working for us . E_S
151559:54	and \[ I , \+ personally , I \] do n't think 0 I would work for somebody if they were going *-2 to reject me on the basis of what *T*-1 's inside my body . E_S
151563:45	do you think 0 it *EXP*-1 's okay for a company to reject somebody *-2 knowing that they 'll take drugs ? E_S
151564:32	I mean * suppose 0 they found out some other way ? E_S
151566:138	Well , \[ \[ I think , \+ I think \] \+ \[ we , \+ I \] think \] 0 the problem here \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ a , \+ a \] drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs . E_S
151577:22	Uh , like I said , some industries , though , I think 0 it 'd be very necessary , E_S
151607:52	I mean \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want *-1 to look at your urine before I 'm going *-2 to talk to you *T*-3 . E_S
151633:55	and I do n't really want you to look at it , \[ or \+ or \] something pretty basic like that , E_S
151643:61	well like you say , I mean , if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt *-4 *T*-1 , then really \[ what people ought *-5 to be doing *T*-2 , \+ I mean , \[ the , \+ the \] employer ought *-6 to be judging \] you on how well you do your work *T*-3 rather than on these other factors . E_S
151665:12	but when somebody leaves work *T*-1 , I do n't think that it *EXP*-2 's the employer 's right * to regulate their life style at all . E_S
151682:53	but an employer , really , I think 0 *T*-2 , has the right *-3 to hire someone on any basis 0 they want *-4 to *?* *T*-1 E_S
151767:89	I guess 0 probably the most helpful thing was that , um , for the rent , we rented like \[ a , \+ a \] rescue squad building or something like that . E_S
151774:60	And , uh , \[ each one of the , \+ everybody \] that *T*-1 showed up donated some money for the rent and \[ for , \+ for \] like soft drinks E_S
151782:46	And each person in the family , you know , brought a dish , or something . E_S
151952:48	\[ So , \+ so \] I see us in \[ a kind , \+ somewhat of a \] catch twenty-two \[ unless we , \+ unless the \] banks or industry and \[ or \+ \] the government go together \[ and , \+ and \] come up with a way 0 * to , uh , have us as a part of the unemployed society be able *-1 to be gainfully employed *-3 again * converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting , uh , compound *T*-2 . E_S
152066:14	Well that sounds adventuresome . E_S
152257:56	and uh , our benefits package \[ is n't , \+ uh , is n't \] quite as good in some ways . Uh , you know , E_S
152303:35	\[ unless you , \+ unless you \] have some vacation time or \[ some , \+ some \] sick leave or whatever , um , you kind of have *-1 to finagle your way around *-2 to get that time . E_S

152359:5	sometimes dental costs can be , um , just about as expensive , if not more , E_S
152370:25	I think 0 it costs me something like five dollars \[ a , \+ a \] month for the dental plan . E_S
152462:5	somewhat that , E_S
152472:57	and I suppose 0 that 's maybe a disadvantage of * being in a larger institution , perhaps somewhat even with the business , uh . E_S
152490:25	I mean , you know , some people had been there a long time . E_S
152494:12	Like in some of the large oil companies . There has been massive lay offs . E_S
152569:103	although \[ he , \+ \] you know , * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *T*-2 the , uh , less difficult it *EXP*-1 is *T*-3 * to kind of carry some things through E_S
152590:40	and , uh , if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up , well then that 's their problem E_S
152831:108	Uh , \[ my , \+ my \] opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state E_S and they say 0 they are going *-1 to send some back , E_S
152910:40	\[ I , \+ I 'd \] like *-1 to see something like that . E_S
152919:36	I mean it *EXP*-3 does n't seem right that somebody that *T*-1 makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that *T*-2 makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes . E_S
152919:89	I mean it *EXP*-3 does n't seem right that somebody that *T*-1 makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that *T*-2 makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes . E_S
152986:68	so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which *T*-1 \[ is \+ really is n't \] too great sometimes . E_S
152996:26	The radio does n't really have much news sometimes . E_S
153004:13	I mean sometimes do you think 0 it gets pretty commercialized E_S
153023:355	\[ Also , \+ also \] I have the observation *ICH*-6 \[ of , \+ uh , with \] the press \[ is \+ \] that , like \[ any \+ any \] stories that I had any first hand knowledge of *T*-1 that I see *T*-2 in the press , you know , which *T*-3 only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for \[ anything of \+ you know \[ or \+ \] anything that \] *T*-4 actually \[ had , \+ had \] more than just a blurb about it . \[ That \+ \] the press has managed *-5 to just mess up some aspect of the story E_S
153030:12	it 's something wrong . E_S
153068:56	Was that like he started *-1 shooting \[ people , \+ people \] in this cafeteria or something ? E_S
153112:15	I mean , somewhere \[ there 's , \+ \] it 's lost a lot of the quality that they use *-1 to have *T*-2 like in Walter Cronkite that if you know N_S
153204:19	Did he raise him or something ? E_S
153229:10	Uh , some lady , she , uh , N_S
153302:52	they seem \[ *-1 to be , \+ I mean , listen \] better or something . E_S
153314:52	\[ They 're \+ their \] cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens E_S
153357:7	and some he destroys *T*-1 E_S
153358:7	and some he keeps *T*-1 . E_S
153399:57	Well , do n't you think that you know , * just having , you know , some , you know almost like a driver 's license be required *-6 you know with stiff penalties if you are found *-5 \[ with , \+ with \] you know a gun that *T*-1 is not registered *-2 or you know that you are not licensed *-3 to carry *T*-4 . E_S
153435:29	because I mean I do think that some people need them \[ and , \+ \] like , for protection and stuff E_S
153480:54	If I get one , I think 0 I will probably , you know , get something . E_S
153492:13	I mean somebody is not going *-1 to break in , steal it , and you know , use it *-2 to mug someone , you know . E_S
153492:76	I mean somebody is not going *-1 to break in , steal it , and you know , use it *-2 to mug someone , you know . E_S
153501:56	\[ and , \+ and \] they 're going *-1 to shoot through five wall , and hit someone , you know . E_S
153505:23	You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever . E_S
153574:37	\[ the , \+ did it \] happen at a cafeteria or something ? E_S
153672:20	Uh , cars are definitely something that you have *-1 to figure *T*-2 into your budget . Not only for * buying them , but for * keeping them on the road too . E_S
153888:20	You know that 's something 0 I miss *T*-1 quite a bit . E_S
153931:85	\[ they , \+ I guess 0 they \] passed a couple of , uh , uh , laws \[ a \+ here while back \] in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go *-1 to buy a hand gun *T*-2 E_S
153957:35	\[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 some forms of guns should probably be controlled *-1
153995:24	You know , I have done some bow hunting E_S
154050:7	and sometimes I 'll read like the , uh , WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES . E_S
154052:7	but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it . E_S
154088:13	or is it something that *T*-1 is , uh , a little bit different from that ? E_S
154139:61	and , uh , the other thing that I always notice *T*-1 is that whenever they write about something that I 'm an expert in *T*-2 *T*-3 , I find their descriptions to be wrong E_S
154149:47	Well , even if it 's not technical . If it 's , uh , some social thing or whatever . It does n't matter . E_S
154306:16	We have gotten some of our loans paid *-1 off really because of this and stuff like that E_S
154553:11	I like some country music . E_S
154734:49	and , uh , I was kind of interested *-1 to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places E_S
154759:31	They were able *-1 to sell it for some amount per ton E_S
154769:18	We *ICH*-2 're doing some here \[ in , \+ in \] Cash Valley , the community here . E_S
154782:72	So one of the real keys , it sounds like *T*-1 , to * getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like that to go is * to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . E_S
154782:102	So one of the real keys , it sounds like *T*-1 , to * getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like that to go is * to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . E_S
154822:19	like a carbon fuel of some sort , E_S
154828:29	And it 's more than even paper or something like that . E_S
154991:37	and I think 0 that keeps \[ a lot , \+ some \] people from *-1 exercising . E_S
155193:47	\[ \[ or \+ or are you , \] \+ or are \[ they \+ some home \] \] distributing the funds back to you . E_S
155202:46	\[ and then I , \+ and then they \] in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that *T*-1 do the canning of the pop and the beer \[ as \+ as \] well . E_S
155205:99	You know \[ there 's a , \+ I heard about a \] similar program in New York City where , uh , a thing called * like Homeless Incorporated or something like that , N_S
155226:17	They have done it some , uh , E_S
155235:11	Uh , some of the , N_S
155242:12	I have some friends of mine who *T*-1 use Quicken E_S
155281:73	but , uh , we 're to the point *ICH*-1 now where our financial income is enough that we can consider *-2 putting some away for college *T*-3 , E_S
155300:12	* find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way 0 we will be able *-1 to , uh , do it *T*-2 . E_S
155307:76	Well our situation is just \[ a little bit , \+ kind of the opposite \] of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job ,
155327:60	I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with , uh , the western accents or something like that . E_S
155336:38	Uh , a colleague of mine at , uh , work got some information over , uh , the computer network called * INTERNET . E_S
155363:18	we could talk about some of the long range goals E_S
155368:62	Uh , well I think , 0 either my wife or I would like *-1 to pursue advanced degrees at some point E_S
155415:45	We 're trying *-1 to think of how * to put away some savings and stuff like that *T*-2 E_S
155421:27	we 'd like *-1 to do that some day . E_S
155540:13	and * said something here when I came home and French to somebody *T*-1 E_S
155540:43	and * said something here when I came home and French to somebody *T*-1 E_S
155569:10	Uh , sometimes \[ it is , \+ there is \] no alternative . E_S
155579:9	So , sometimes it 's not an alternative . E_S
155583:48	\[ And I think , \+ uh , but I think \] also , 0 sometimes it can be , uh , a benefit if it 's for a short time . E_S
155596:25	\[ Sometimes \+ you know , sometimes \] the nursing homes are good for , uh , just short periods of time . E_S
155612:26	\[ So \+ so \] there is some good to it . E_S
155618:10	Uh , sometimes too , it 's used *-1 as a dumb job . E_S
155641:88	if my parents were *-1 to get ill , I would like *-2 to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help . E_S
155659:27	So \[ that , \+ that \] option sometimes is not available if they do not have \[ the , \+ \] uh , either Medicare or insurance 0 *T*-1 to cover it . E_S
155671:20	and then there 's also some that *T*-1 are set *-2 up for specialties E_S
155675:16	uh , I know some . E_S
155676:10	Unfortunately , some elderly \[ have * to go to \+ or have , \] I guess 0 it 's *RNR*-2 Alzheimer 's or where they wonder \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , confused or have some mental problem *T*-1 . E_S

155726:30	and \[ I \+ I 've \] seen some of them like that too E_S
155749:46	and , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] hope that I have something like that when I get older *T*-1 . E_S
155762:24	and , uh , you know , sometimes \[ it can , \+ \[ those choi- , \+ those choices \] can \] be made *-1 in advance E_S
155763:7	and sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they 're , N_S
155768:23	Uh , guy , E_S uh , some of my things , E_S \[ I , \+ I 'd \] like *-1 to have a short work week you know , E_S
155912:72	Some people *ICH*-3 can be let *-2 go and replaced *-2 like , uh , say , uh , a typist , uh , somebody who *T*-1 does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist . E_S
155945:65	I think 0 by *-1 putting term limitations on \[ you could , \+ you could \] slow down some of the problems . E_S
155950:11	I know some senators , E_S
155980:262	Uh , \[ the only prob- , \+ the only problem \] 0 I see *T*-1 with term limitations , uh , is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as * is *?* \[ in , \+ with \] most governments is just so complex that \[ there 's a very lar- , \+ you know , \[ there , \+ there \] is a learning curve \] and that , you know , you \[ d- , \+ \] ca n't just send someone off to Washington and expect , you know , his first day to be an effective , uh , Congress person . E_S
156065:131	But \[ I , \+ I \] think that \[ there are , \+ there are \] advantages to * having seniority \[ and , \+ uh , \[ turn- , \+ \] or , \] not having a complete turnover every , some small number of years . E_S
156141:19	and muffler falls off or something E_S
156153:21	and I think also 0 some of the , uh , car companies are coming out with , uh , gas powered fleets so you , N_S
156223:103	Well , you also have the very close related thing of the , uh , rain forest destruction which *T*-1 is the main source of what *T*-2 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants . E_S
156247:36	Well , \[ not , \+ not \] as hard as some places out west because you do n't get the , uh , major pollution sources as you do out in Denver *ICH*-2 with the inversion and Los Angeles and \[ a- , \+ \] rest of California which *T*-1 is just terrible it sounds . E_S
156315:10	Oh , something . E_S
156335:70	and I also try and read one of the , uh , major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE , or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that . E_S
156355:40	but I swear 0 it 's at least second or third grade , sometimes . E_S
156365:47	uh , I think 0 if you listen to like N P R or something like , N_S
156419:18	I had , uh , some visitor E_S
156431:124	Well , \[ but the \+ but the \] \[ \[ ne- , \+ news , \] \+ news \] that you would get *T*-1 from any other source is being generated *-2 from that event , which *T*-3 is something that *T*-4 's good *ICH*-5 also about C Span which \[ I , \+ I \] tune into *T*-6 every once in a while . E_S
156441:69	\[ if , \+ if \] you do n't watch it there , then you 're going *-1 to hear somebody else 's canned , uh , report , somebody else 's view about it E_S

E_S
156527:11	you buy something on credit E_S
156552:49	it 's so much \[ easy , \+ easier , \] you know , if something 's on sale if you 're a woman and you 're a sale person , E_S
156599:32	I do n't understand the idea of * paying somebody *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] do it . E_S
156603:68	It seems like it 's absurd the number of people who *T*-1 end up *-2 having *-3 to pay somebody *-4 to do it . E_S
156618:53	I mean , it *EXP*-1 seems absurd that people will pay , you know , some bucks just *-2 to get someone to , N_S
156618:72	I mean , it *EXP*-1 seems absurd that people will pay , you know , some bucks just *-2 to get someone to , N_S
156624:25	I guess 0 if you had some really complicated stuff , E_S
156696:133	And then , I was reading in the paper just this morning , it 's interesting because I had forgotten , I guess 0 *T*-1 , that I wrote this little topic down , that it *EXP*-3 costs more *ICH*-2 * to execute somebody \[ th- , \+ than \] it *EXP*-4 does * to keep them . Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know . E_S
156750:54	I mean , course , you could n't do that because you got *-2 to do something with the ones that *T*-1 are already there E_S
156793:8	but some of them have already been in youth centers . And that kind of thing , E_S
156797:18	and if we had something 0 * to do *T*-1 before they get *-2 to be full-blown adult criminals , E_S
156804:8	and some of them are our problems , E_S
156815:68	Anyway , I dealt with two or three kids *ICH*-5 today that *T*-1 are going *-2 to end up where somebody \[ has , \+ \] making a decision what * to do *T*-3 with them *T*-4 . E_S
156825:41	but if you could find a way 0 * to prevent some of it *T*-4 , and I 'm not sure what it would be *T*-1 . It would be money better *ICH*-2 spent * than , N_S
156851:33	I 'm for it \[ in \+ in \] some cases . E_S
156878:20	Well , you know , somebody elected that recently . E_S
156945:91	\[ \[ \[ one , \+ one , \] \+ one h- , \] \+ one humorous \] retort 0 I \[ heard , \+ heard *T*-2 \] someone , you know , who *T*-1 claimed that , you know , AIDS was , you know , God 's punishment was that , then lesbians must be God 's chosen people . E_S
157050:25	I think 0 I 've seen some statistics that *T*-1 say that , uh , it *EXP*-2 's more expensive *ICH*-3 * to kill somebody than * to keep them in prison for life . E_S
157050:81	I think 0 I 've seen some statistics that *T*-1 say that , uh , it *EXP*-2 's more expensive *ICH*-3 * to kill somebody than * to keep them in prison for life . E_S

157088:134	\[ but , \+ but \] the other side to that is , 0 if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , \[ or , \+ \] you know , and somehow redeem himself . E_S
157092:10	but in some cases , yes . E_S
157136:78	\[ \[ w- , \+ w- , \] \+ we 're \] going *-1 to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something . E_S
157141:93	but you look at \[ our , \+ our \] crime rates and things like that and you compare them \[ to , \+ to \] like Texas or someplace that *T*-1 does , you know , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] impossible * to make a case that \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] affecting it in any way . E_S
157165:190	And , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 when you listen to like \[ \[ the , uh , \+ the , \] \+ the \] victims ' families and things *T*-2 , they 're always talking about , you know , uh , *-1 feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they 've gotten something out of it , E_S
157168:30	, I mean , N_S obviously , if someone of mine who *T*-1 has close died , I 'd probably feel differently , E_S
157195:11	So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say , well , the problem is 0 \[ you , \+ you 've \] got an endorphin imbalance E_S
157200:44	you really get back to the question of , you know , is someone responsible for their actions . E_S
157203:39	well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 on some of it , you have *-1 to say 0 someone 's responsible for his actions . E_S
157203:70	well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 on some of it , you have *-1 to say 0 someone 's responsible for his actions . E_S
157443:28	Uh , I think , well , 0 something on the order of a three series , it 's probably different . E_S
157523:25	We do think that , uh , sometimes , uh , we have a reverse of a regressive tax , a progressive tax . E_S
157562:32	You pay gasoline taxes every time 0 you pump something into \[ your , \+ your \] tank *T*-1 . E_S
157579:127	one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for * doing away with all \[ the , \+ the \] tax codes 0 they have *T*-1 now and implementing \[ a f- , \+ I think a flat \] percentage , something like that . E_S
157604:22	Up until , like , eighty-five or something was the , N_S
157609:130	So , uh , with the issue of trial by jury , uh , I actually found the whole question about whether you need \[ \[ a , \+ a unan- , \] \+ a unanimous \] verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting . E_S
157631:97	And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be wrong * to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . E_S
157650:23	I 've been out here twenty some years E_S
157662:180	Well , the people 0 I know *T*-1 who *T*-2 have served have said that usually what *T*-3 ends up *-4 happening is that , you know , after initially * finding out where people stand *T*-5 , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is \[ a , \+ you know , something like a \] nine , three \[ or , \+ or \] more severe \[ and , \+ and \] the people in the majority trying *-6 to convince the minority that they 're right E_S
157668:160	Well , \[ the , \+ the \] one thing that I know 0 *T*-1 does seem *-2 to happen from people 0 I 've talked to *T*-3 on this , is that in the situation 0 you just said *T*-4 where it 's nine to three , or some such number *T*-5 , \[ that there 's , an effect 0 *T*-7 starts *-8 being \+ that there 's starts *-6 being \] a lot of peer pressure going on E_S
157673:10	and in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire *ICH*-1 of people *-2 to get out of there and not be stuck *-2 in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . E_S
157676:109	I 'd read one book , I think 0 it was calls *-1 TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh *T*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases *-3 looking \[ at what *T*-4 had , \+ \] at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations . E_S
157763:100	and we find out that , you know , no matter what kind of budget you stick on *T*-1 , there 's always going *-2 to be an unexpected car repair or something happen * with the house , that you have *-3 to have money *ICH*-6 for *T*-4 and , uh , not enough * to go and to take a loan out , but , uh , you have *-5 to have money for *T*-4 . E_S
157874:7	And sometimes that 's a little hard with books and music \[ and , \+ and \] sheet music and stuff 0 you 've got *-1 to work on *T*-2 , too . E_S
158089:67	Well , I do think 0 with working parents \[ it is , \+ I mean , there are \] some real issues here . Um , that I think , um , N_S
158116:34	And it has , um , helped us to afford some things for our children that we could n't otherwise *?* *T*-2 that I think 0 *T*-1 are wonderful particularly at this age , E_S
158170:23	but I really do think 0 sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children E_S
158207:58	\[ \[ I \+ really , uh , I , \] \+ I \] ca n't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people . E_S
158218:98	But , um , he said that \[ he would , \+ he would \] want *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] seriously hurt *RNR*-2 or if not kill *RNR*-2 someone \[ if , \+ if \] they did something to his wife . E_S
158218:126	But , um , he said that \[ he would , \+ he would \] want *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] seriously hurt *RNR*-2 or if not kill *RNR*-2 someone \[ if , \+ if \] they did something to his wife . E_S
158222:79	Oh , \[ it 's a , \+ uh , it 's a \] question of \[ your , \+ your \] gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response . E_S
158227:81	Uh , \[ a- , \+ and \] that was the thing that , uh , *T*-1 killed Dukakis back , uh , four years ago when someone asked him a similar question *T*-2 E_S
158232:209	And I think that the people who *T*-1 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level . E_S Uh , you know , whether it be a biblical force , uh , you know , the eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a \[ knife , \+ life \] type logic or just , uh , uh , some sort of anger at * \[ putting peop- , \+ putting , uh , murderers \] up in federal pens for the rest of their life , uh , while we foot the bill . E_S

158343:99	It 's like they 're saying well on the one hand \[ they 're not , \+ he 's not \] getting a jury of his peers which *T*-1 is in some ways I think 0 *T*-2 true . E_S
158370:62	but \[ I , \+ I \] rather imagine 0 \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] some snickering about it . And a lot of the usually fatalistic , uh , here we go again folks , kind of stuff . E_S

158525:22	this child was crying and needed some comfort , you know , E_S
158555:157	It sounds like *ICH*-1 to me \[ your , \+ your \] concern would be * to make * sure that they are loving people . . Affectionate people that \[ they 're , \+ they 're \[ kind of par- , \+ may be parents \] \] themselves or something . E_S
158627:38	In fact , it was called *-1 Humpty Dumpty Play School or something , E_S
158631:39	but \[ they also did , \+ they also did \] some of the teaching things E_S
158665:46	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 there 's definitely been some changes , um , E_S
158704:32	and it must have reflected , uh , uh , some awful good , uh , diplomacy on the part of the U S . E_S
158868:9	\[ sometimes , \+ many times \] I end up *-1 feeling like I 'm paying too much in taxes . E_S

158910:30	Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that ? E_S
159122:18	then I know of some of the people that *T*-1 have gotten their masters E_S
159169:20	but it would definitely be something 0 * to look into *T*-1 once I get my own . E_S
159194:33	But \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] some weird law where , uh , uh , student employees working for the government do n't have *-1 to pay Social Security tax *T*-2 . E_S
159220:123	\[ I have , \+ so I have \] *-1 to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid *-5 *T*-2 real *T*-3 , you know , because if I was working somewhere else I 'd have *-4 to , you know , pay an extra five percent , or so . E_S
159266:27	And I think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous , you know , like millions and millions of dollars . E_S
159274:140	Each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what , um , \[ the going , \+ you know , if you will *?* the going , \] uh , award should be *T*-1 for a certain type of case , you know , within some kind of range . E_S
159280:82	Who it really penalizes *T*-1 is their insurance company which *T*-2 then translates into higher rates for all of us . If they get some of those mega awards against them . E_S
159294:21	And , uh , granted 0 some people need *-1 to be compensated *-2 if they have really been wronged *-3 , you know . E_S
159296:86	Well , how do you feel *T*-2 about * setting , like , well , for example , \[ a car type accident where , \+ uh , or some incident \] where someone loses a limb *T*-1 . E_S
159296:99	Well , how do you feel *T*-2 about * setting , like , well , for example , \[ a car type accident where , \+ uh , or some incident \] where someone loses a limb *T*-1 . E_S
159302:14	You know some of the health insurance is written *-1 that way . You know , that , uh , if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy , you know , it s- , pre specified in the policy so much E_S
159303:62	but I do n't know that you can necessarily put \[ a , \+ a \] value *ICH*-3 on somebody 's limb , uh , arbitrarily that *T*-1 is always going *-2 to fit in all cases . E_S
159312:47	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it has *-1 to be some kind of common sense applied * there . E_S
159326:19	because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury 's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards , it really , you know , ultimately is not penalizing the person that they 're trying *T*-1 for get away . E_S
159355:43	\[ For , \+ for \] honest mistakes where they 've done something \[ and , \+ and \] something happens *T*-1 . E_S

159378:28	and he drops a load of lumber on somebody E_S
159389:10	But in some instances you 're going *-1 to put companies out of business by *-2 taking that stance , if they have *-3 to take it out of their own retained earnings . E_S
159419:36	And \[ if , \+ if \] they know 0 some practice is wrong , you know , N_S
159422:21	maybe they 're willfully manufacturing something that they know 0 *T*-1 is hurting people out there E_S
159430:44	Then I think 0 they ought *-1 to have *-2 to pay something out of their own pocket . E_S
159437:33	And , uh , then I had *-1 to do some volunteer work here in Tyler , Texas E_S
159498:72	and both my , uh , aunts and uncle work . Which *T*-1 means 0 it 's , you know , very difficult for some- , N_S
159502:25	you essentially need *-1 to have someone taking care of the person full-time . E_S
159514:8	And some of the really nice ones that *T*-1 really take care of their people are so expensive . \[ Because \+ cause \] they can afford *-2 to hire the people that *T*-3 are really going * to care for the older . E_S
159522:24	and , you know , the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that *T*-1 just very easily tends *-2 to disappear in the nursing homes . E_S
159531:7	and someone visited him every day . E_S

159693:17	\[ Som- , \+ sometimes \] I do . E_S
159743:40	\[ I , \+ I \] even like Guns and Roses , some of their stuff . E_S

159950:34	Do you \[ like , \+ uh , like \] someone recent ? Like Enya ? E_S
159961:28	And , uh , \[ she 's gotten some , \+ uh , she 's been on \] like the top ten , I guess 0 *T*-1 , or whatever . E_S
159970:32	I guess that * 's not large compared to some , E_S
159998:71	and then the rest is whatever you want *-1 to put *T*-2 in . If you put more than that or something like that . E_S
160012:43	It 's like hundred bucks \[ a , \+ a \] month or something for a family . E_S
160025:53	\[ It 's , \+ uh , it \] saves a third off on taxes or something . E_S
160033:46	So , \[ \[ the- , \+ \] it , \+ you know , someone \] did start a cost benefit analysis , E_S

160311:15	There should be someplace where you could call *T*-1 and find out . E_S

160515:21	They treat it with chemicals or something ? E_S
160520:27	like yellow paper , you know takes something like twenty times as long *-1 to decompose . E_S
160608:36	I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts *-1 to talk about it . E_S

161209:14	Well , because some people , uh , want *-1 to train them as , N_S
161272:36	they 're banned *-1 \[ from , \+ in \] some areas I understand 0 *T*-2 . E_S

161351:15	I do have some thoughts on that , E_S

162807:36	Something 0 I picked *T*-1 up in a psychology class some time ago . E_S
162812:65	it 's that * the younger 0 they are *T*-2 , they tend *-1 to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason , E_S
162828:72	Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such *T*-1 . I think 0 there ought *-2 to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . E_S
162829:91	And in civil law there , you know , is such a thing as like , * let 's say , uh , misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that . E_S
162842:89	Well , do you think \[ that , \+ that \] in a civil case , if there was majority rule , that it *EXP*-2 would be easy for someone to be set *-1 up ? E_S
162869:49	And , you know , they like *-1 to think that they 're getting someone who *T*-2 's objective in all this , E_S
162870:23	but they 're really looking for someone who *T*-1 will pretty much fulfill the lawyers ' desires . E_S
162893:13	Does it say something ? E_S
162983:49	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 a lot of people around here sometimes have , like , mothers or grandmothers that *T*-1 take care of their kids E_S
162989:23	you either know them or know somebody who *T*-1 knows them , 0 *T*-4 to get *-2 to , N_S
163064:12	that 's something 0 I 've considered *T*-1 .
163133:58	I think 0 what they need *-2 to do *T*-1 is , they need *-3 to somehow take the money out of it . E_S
163203:23	* Leave the details up to somebody else , huh . E_S
163214:15	I think 0 somehow you have *-1 to separate the revenues from , N_S
163219:45	and if he gets in there and starts *-1 rooting around and finds something in there that *T*-2 's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it . E_S
163221:82	Now , if he comes in and says , you know , I 'll repair \[ your , \+ your \] V C R , or somebody else 's V C R , for a hundred dollars , gets in there , N_S maybe it 's a blown fuse , E_S
163225:118	So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a civil , \] \+ uh , somebody suing somebody else , \] you get X dollars for that case E_S
163225:125	So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a civil , \] \+ uh , somebody suing somebody else , \] you get X dollars for that case E_S
163289:33	I think 0 at each Wal-Mart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which *T*-1 now , N_S
163356:17	Uh , I bought some Cokes *ICH*-1 the other day in \[ the br- , \+ the little bottles \] you know , E_S
163370:65	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] \[ they were like , \+ it was like \] two dollars and something for the bottles . E_S
163402:36	but \[ I , \+ I \] do know 0 some of these places were doing that E_S
163458:200	and \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ \[ I 'll do this for , \+ I was doing this for , \] \+ actually , I was going *-1 to do it for \] my son \[ so that he could , \+ uh , \[ he , \+ he 's \] in high school , so that he could \] make some money . E_S
163527:37	\[ it 's just part , \+ it 's just something \] that *T*-1 turns up in the other parameters that they test for *T*-2 . E_S
163531:87	But I think 0 it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have *-1 to exercise some quick judgment in the field . E_S
163552:57	and then if you get injured *-1 on the job , if you like trip and fall or something , uh , they give you a drug test right away . E_S
163578:60	\[ \[ I guess \+ I k- , \] \+ I think \] 0 it 's got some relevance , E_S
163598:67	\[ they 're , \+ they should \] be able *-1 to make it as a continue of employment in some sense E_S
163649:39	\[ and , \+ and \] supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn 0 * to retire *T*-1 *T*-2 , the money will be there for us . E_S
163661:10	Uh , someone was telling me that \[ there is a , \+ uh , uh , there 's still an \] office \[ in , \+ \] uh , you know , staffed * \[ with , \+ with \] people *ICH*-3 there and , in D C that *T*-1 are researching *-2 to find a cure for polio , \[ which , \+ \] N_S
163669:47	I know 0 we have a polio vaccine come 0 *T*-2 will prevent somebody from *-1 getting polio E_S
163673:61	I 'm not sure if we know what * to do *T*-2 in terms of * curing some who *T*-1 has already gotten polio . E_S
163682:37	\[ \[ that , \+ that histor- , \] \+ for some reason , historical sites \] with , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] full federal money and everything seem *-1 to appear \[ \[ as , \+ as \] \+ almost as \] like political favors \[ to , \+ to \] very strong politicians . E_S
163691:87	So , it sounds like \[ you , \+ uh , you \] think \[ that , \+ that \] we 'd be able *-1 to save some money by , uh *-2 passing the line item veto . E_S
163708:37	there 's a political term for this stuff , pork barrel or something . E_S
163717:52	\[ \[ The- , \+ the- , \] \+ there \] has *-1 to be some way 0 * to do it *T*-2 . E_S
163749:16	Uh , I know some , N_S
163775:38	I 'm more , uh , old rock and roll , uh , some \[ new , \+ newer , \] I guess 0 you would call it *ICH*-1 heavy metal rock and roll type you know , uh , Van Halen , that kind of thing . E_S
163790:14	So , \[ some \+ some \] of the older Eagles stuff was good . E_S
163790:21	So , \[ some \+ some \] of the older Eagles stuff was good . E_S
163805:15	But , uh , some of their older \[ s- , \+ stuff \] was , uh , you know , quite enjoyable to me . E_S
163814:31	\[ that does , \+ that 's \] something 0 \[ you do n't , \+ *T*-1 does n't \] even sound good *-2 loud really . You know . E_S
163819:68	Uh , so , anything new 0 you like *T*-1 *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 coming out now , other than folk music , some 0 I might know of *T*-2 . E_S
163851:17	I think 0 some of them , the artists are even , uh , hitting the pop charts . E_S
163895:24	and I think , 0 if somebody else were *-1 to play that , you know , \[ they would n't , \+ \[ \[ they , \+ nobody , \] \+ everybody \] would \] think , that 's lousy , E_S
163962:40	or , about the only new music 0 I hear *T*-1 is somebody else that I know *T*-2 will buy something new that I have n't heard *T*-3 E_S
163962:67	or , about the only new music 0 I hear *T*-1 is somebody else that I know *T*-2 will buy something new that I have n't heard *T*-3 E_S
163969:34	I do n't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I 've heard it . E_S
163972:57	see , that 's one thing 0 I like *T*-1 about \[ the , \+ uh , some \] of the folk music scenes , you know , E_S
164015:113	although on the college campuses , uh , there are , uh , cases of , you know , like people getting \[ machine from a , \+ from an automated teller \] and , you know , somebody trying *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] device a scam \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , *-1 getting the money for them that *T*-2 actually preys mostly on foreigners . E_S
164022:35	well , I guess 0 here we run into that sometime , E_S
164027:11	There are some , but \[ not , \+ not \] very high . E_S
164036:97	uh , a strange case \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 happened , oh , it 's *RNR*-2 \[ about , \+ about \] a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine . E_S
164071:31	it 's not like , uh , it 's someone do steal \[ a , \+ a \] or television or V C R or something like that E_S
164071:76	it 's not like , uh , it 's someone do steal \[ a , \+ a \] or television or V C R or something like that E_S
164093:33	Uh , it *EXP*-3 would be so easy for someone who *T*-1 is motivated *-4 to do so to just , you know , sit out back , take a look at when people are here *T*-2 and when they 're not *?* *T*-5 just come in , you know , E_S
164119:29	* Buying a car is , uh , something 0 you 're contemplating *T*-1 , I take it 0 *T*-2 . E_S
164150:65	Well , since I just turned forty , I 'm thinking about a forty year old man 's car , \[ something , \+ uh , something \] real sporty E_S
164150:79	Well , since I just turned forty , I 'm thinking about a forty year old man 's car , \[ something , \+ uh , something \] real sporty E_S
164154:75	but , uh , realistically with , uh , the need * to take the kids to school , * probably have *-1 to have something that , uh , *T*-2 would n't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *T*-4 . E_S
164178:6	something that *T*-1 will carry it around careful , I guess 0 *T*-3 is \[ best , \+ best \] way 0 * to describe it *T*-2 . E_S
164181:49	I know 0 \[ they s- , \+ they 're coming \] out with some V eight now E_S
164186:18	so , they 've got some pretty powerful sixes . E_S
164198:48	but there 's so many occasions when I 've had *-1 to move some members of the family or do this or that *T*-2 , E_S
164221:38	and we were n't aware of it , and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car , E_S
164223:15	So , we got some monster studded snow tires after that . E_S
164239:23	and it 's , uh , got some nice features in terms of * being able *-1 to remove seats and flip them around E_S
164243:29	so we 've been able *-1 to do some real creative , uh , load hauling when * called upon *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
164258:56	I think that we 're going *-1 to be , uh , owning a mini van for some years 0 *T*-2 to come . E_S
164262:11	Is that something that you 'd be interested in *T*-1 E_S
164333:23	\[ I , \+ \] in some ways , it 's almost worse than murder . E_S
164353:85	\[ What , \+ what \] do you think 0 *T*-1 \[ is , \+ uh , is \] an appropriate , uh , punishment for \[ some of the various , \+ \] you know , \[ such as , \+ things such as \] rape \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , murder or something like that . E_S
164353:173	\[ What , \+ what \] do you think 0 *T*-1 \[ is , \+ uh , is \] an appropriate , uh , punishment for \[ some of the various , \+ \] you know , \[ such as , \+ things such as \] rape \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , murder or something like that . E_S
164386:68	\[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] year 's plenty of time you know , for something to come out , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
164407:36	But , I think 0 you have *-1 to accept some of the errors . E_S
164463:217	and , uh , the premeditated murders , the ones where the person plots and plans *T*-1 , when you catch \[ those , \+ those \] individuals *T*-2 , I think that *T*-4 \[ you , \+ you \] \[ \[ end up with a , \+ uh , uh , how do I want *-5 to , you end up with a s- , \] \+ you end up with someone \] who *T*-3 's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time . E_S
164490:115	and they do n't \[ think that , \+ uh , stop and think and say , \] well , maybe I should n't do this , uh , because , uh , I might get the gas chamber or something like that . E_S
164495:23	Well , I think that in some cases , it is warranted . E_S
164502:18	I think 0 in some cases it *EXP*-1 does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not . E_S
164519:13	Well , for some things . E_S
164523:61	I think 0 for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who *T*-1 would do something like that in cold blood , N_S
164554:98	\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] a difficult , uh , problem , is n't it *?* , * to determine how you 're going *-2 to punish somebody for a particular crime *T*-3 , uh , E_S
164556:49	But , then , you know , I think \[ that , \+ that \] some murderers do n't really warrant capital punishment . You know , \[ just , \+ \] like , for example , uh , you know , you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who *T*-1 abused them *T*-2 E_S
164585:50	I know 0 they \[ put , \+ uh , put \] them in jail sometimes , I guess .
164605:86	but , uh , it used *-1 to be 0 a long time ago , I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment *T*-2 , if somebody did something , for example , to your family , then you had the right * to administer the punishment . E_S
164605:92	but , uh , it used *-1 to be 0 a long time ago , I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment *T*-2 , if somebody did something , for example , to your family , then you had the right * to administer the punishment . E_S
164606:11	So if somebody killed somebody in your family , then \[ you had the right * to , \+ uh , if that person was caught *-1 and found *-1 guilty , you had the right * to , \] uh , execute that person . E_S
164606:18	So if somebody killed somebody in your family , then \[ you had the right * to , \+ uh , if that person was caught *-1 and found *-1 guilty , you had the right * to , \] uh , execute that person . E_S
164607:28	And I know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , I would feel that I had the right * \[ to , \+ to \] get revenge on them E_S
164607:37	And I know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , I would feel that I had the right * \[ to , \+ to \] get revenge on them E_S
164627:40	But , like I said , \[ if , \+ if \] someone \[ is , \+ is \] just pathologically going *-1 to murder people no matter what then I think 0 they should be eliminated *-2 from society . E_S
164707:33	and occasionally in the morning , I 'll pick up something like , uh , C N N or that , E_S
164712:21	so you have a paper or something or , N_S
164773:21	Uh , if there 's something 0 you want *-1 to know *T*-2 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] in the TIMES \[ and then , \+ \[ and \] in detail . E_S
164793:53	Although \[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] sorry *-1 to see some of their , uh , N_S
164795:79	\[ \[ But , \+ uh , a- , \] \+ and \] occasionally \[ I , \+ I \] pick up like TIME magazine or something I think 0 *T*-1 , uh , if they 've got an interesting lead story , E_S
164916:49	\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] nice * to hear someone 's interpretation of it E_S
164929:134	One of the things that I found *T*-1 interesting last year during \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Gulf conflict was a sentiment against , uh , Peter Arnett , who *T*-2 had stayed in Iraq and was presenting , uh , some of the things that *T*-3 were available . E_S
165008:23	And that \[ would result in some , \+ uh , could result in more \] equitable distribution of money E_S
165017:60	There was n't as many advanced placement courses *ICH*-3 , uh , when I was a senior *T*-1 that some other schools had *T*-2 . E_S
165038:58	All these kids have these \[ really supportive , \+ really supportive \] parents , always up there for something . E_S
165108:23	* ended up *-1 getting some scholarships 0 * to go to college *T*-2 \[ and \+ \] \[ which *T*-3 has been , \+ you know , which *T*-4 is \] really nice , E_S
165174:15	I was reading something in , uh , CONSUMER REPORTS *ICH*-1 tonight about that as a matter of fact . E_S
165349:77	Something that I find *T*-1 uncomfortable is , you know , 0 \[ you , \+ you \] want *-3 to buy something ,
165380:15	and they wanted something like fifteen dollars , uh , a front or something like that E_S
165380:42	and they wanted something like fifteen dollars , uh , a front or something like that E_S
165389:35	the other thing 0 I let them do *T*-1 some times is that I let them go through and \[ let them tell me what , \+ let them do \] the diagnostics . E_S
165437:28	Well it sounds like you 've had some good experiences with that E_S
165521:46	So , uh , uh , \[ we , \+ yeah , we \] have somewhat of , uh , a system . E_S
165567:40	and one of these days I am going *-1 to do something about that I believe 0 *T*-2 . E_S
165636:12	you have something 0 *T*-1 to take it out . E_S
165642:5	sometimes \[ if you , \+ if you \] save so much , then they will match it . E_S
165669:42	and then with that I try and handle , you know , some of the clothes that the girls need *T*-1 and things like that , E_S
165759:38	and then you have *-1 to really sit down and plan some more E_S
165808:15	I 've heard some about Saturns . E_S
165810:64	I have n't been over , uh , to a dealer *-2 to look at them although I did see something in tonight 's paper that *T*-1 said that their , uh reliability is rated *-3 to be equal to that of \[ the , \+ I guess , the \] Japanese cars . E_S
165842:31	And I found that while you can find some cars that *T*-1 are comfortable 0 * to ride in *T*-2 , uh , * finding a \[ ca- , \+ car \] *ICH*-5 anymore \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's \] fairly easy 0 for me to work on *T*-6 , \[ it 's just not very eas- , \+ it 's not very , \] N_S
165868:58	\[ I , \+ I 'd \] have *-1 to almost go *-2 take a class or something like that . E_S
165905:15	I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses *ICH*-2 over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips *T*-1 . Uh , as rental cars . E_S
165946:33	A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know . E_S
165950:16	Year old ninety-two or something like that . E_S
166012:17	\[ Some , \+ some \] local communities are very active \[ in that , \+ uh , in that \] respect E_S
166015:45	and , uh , they 're not , uh , too inclined *-1 to do something as aggressive as that . E_S
166025:171	\[ \[ I , \+ I know 0 a lot , \] \+ I think 0 a lot \] of , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 \[ to do , \+ to do \] something like that because it does take extra effort . E_S
166032:68	Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious *T*-3 . It 's just the fact that it 's something 0 they have *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S
166058:129	I think 0 here \[ if they , \+ uh , instead of * just , you know , requiring that you \[ put , \+ put \] out the trash and stuff , if they *ICH*-2 \] could get some kind of rebate , those people who *T*-1 do put the stuff out , uh , you know , and separate it , have lower collection fee or something * may encourage people to separate .

E_S
166099:34	Now I think 0 they 've come up with some way of , uh , * pulling the glue out . E_S
166239:12	And then , sometimes \[ I , \+ I \] often , uh , find that maybe there 's so many different things available to us . \[ Yo- , \+ \] a microwave , a V C R , a answering machine \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a special , \] \+ a \] dishwasher , uh , a refrigerator and some of those items , um , \[ for the , \+ for the , \] uh , N_S

166296:15	I mean , somebody 's \[ getting , \+ getting \] a good education because we , continue *-1 to employ people . E_S
166324:27	I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know *T*-1 personally get paid *-2 an awful lot more than , N_S
166332:14	But there are some school districts out there that *T*-1 are very well paid . E_S
166552:34	It 's like if we tried *-1 to start something *-2 to take over major league baseball . E_S
166577:39	But , when in reality , it 's really Americans playing somewhere else *T*-1 you know . N_S
166609:11	That 's some brutal stuff there . E_S
166613:12	Rugby is something else . E_S
166617:54	\[ there 's an element \+ there 's definitely an element \] of stupidity in there somewhere . E_S
166625:36	Rugby is definitely big in college E_S because it 's something 0 a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do *T*-1 . E_S
166731:99	Well , uh , one of the things \[ that , \+ uh , that \] I found *T*-1 to be , uh , an invasion is when I pay for something with a credit card *T*-2 and they ask me *-3 to put my telephone number \[ on the , \+ on the , \] uh , credit card bill *T*-2 . E_S
166732:12	That is something that *T*-1 is not required *-2 E_S
166755:21	I 'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all . E_S
166776:91	And I think that , \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] one thing \[ f- , \+ * to , \] uh , voluntarily give it because someone asks . E_S
166779:41	and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody . You know , E_S
166789:12	That 's something that , uh , people have seen *T*-1 . E_S
166790:41	Oh , here 's *T*-2 an easy way 0 * to make some money *T*-1 . E_S
166792:44	\[ I , \+ I 've \] heard , fairly recently , uh , some talk about that \[ in this , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] my \] state . E_S
166804:21	Whenever you donate money to someone *T*-1 ? E_S
166808:38	\[ They , \+ you \] become , put *-1 on something like a sucker list E_S
166849:68	and they actually happen *-1 to be people who *T*-2 \[ are , \+ graduated \] in your class or something like that . E_S
166864:21	There 's no need for someone who *T*-1 is soliciting should know at all . E_S
166920:103	Because , uh , \[ I th- , \+ you know , I think \] 0 for a lot of people it really is the decision of , do they still have some of their life left . E_S
166926:72	And so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] guess 0 most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home *T*-1 , it 's more a case of where they are not able *-2 to look after their day-to-day needs *T*-3 . E_S
166932:14	but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able *-1 to deal with *T*-2 physically anymore . E_S
166934:28	They generally were able *-1 to have someone care for them at home E_S
166949:30	And a level four type of care would be someone that *T*-1 really requires long-term hospital care . Generally are not able *-2 to look after \[ this- , \+ themselves \] \[ to very , \+ to a very \] great extent , physically . E_S
166950:129	Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer 's Disease \[ \[ or those \+ or , \] \+ or \] physical and mental handicaps . Uh , you know , where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind . Even though it may be minimal *T*-1 . E_S
166957:30	at least , I mean I think 0 some nursing homes do that . E_S
166964:64	I think that a majority of the places in the U S , uh , you know , there is some government aid available , E_S
166974:17	* Definitely does need some improvements .
166994:31	I think 0 I have a severe demeanor or something . E_S
167003:46	and I suppose 0 an elitist might say , well , you really want someone who *T*-1 is well educated *-2 to be able *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] winnow the facts \[ from the , \+ from the \] prejudice . E_S
167026:120	So , that 's why the defense is there *-1 picking through them *T*-4 , whereas at the same time , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] prosecutor sitting there *-3 picking through them because he wants somebody who *T*-2 will give him , uh , a guilty verdict if the facts warrant . E_S
167035:53	I think 0 that should be left *-2 up to people who *T*-1 have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have *?* . E_S
167062:56	Matter of fact , \[ I 've heard that , \+ I 've heard that \] some of the information *ICH*-2 , uh , is prevented *-1 from *-1 reaching the jury , like , uh , mitigating circumstances \[ or , \+ or \] preceding , uh , criminal record or things of this nature that , N_S
167114:80	So , * let 's talk about the , uh , wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order *T*-1 E_S
167126:72	I mean what if you do n't even realize that you 're subject to * paying , uh , income tax on something that you purchase *T*-1 mail order ? E_S
167130:44	Um , \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ naturally \[ some , \+ some \] \] things you just ca n't find *T*-1 in your local K-Mart \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , Bryn Mawr stereo dealer . E_S
167130:52	Um , \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ naturally \[ some , \+ some \] \] things you just ca n't find *T*-1 in your local K-Mart \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , Bryn Mawr stereo dealer . E_S
167135:71	Well , I mean , it seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when I purchase something mail order *T*-2 , it 's not * to circumvent *-1 paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania . E_S
167152:12	\[ With some , \+ with something \] like that , \[ d- , \+ do \] your arguments still apply ? E_S
167152:24	\[ With some , \+ with something \] like that , \[ d- , \+ do \] your arguments still apply ? E_S
167166:58	And \[ \[ I , \+ I \] \+ I \] was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then \[ having , \+ having \] *-1 to pay sales tax on it . E_S
167175:44	And \[ there r- , \+ there are \] \[ s- , \+ some \] substantial , nasty penalties , um , \[ if you , \+ if businesses \] try *-1 to avoid that . E_S
167197:74	Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves , then I think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity \[ f- , \+ \] * to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided *-2 . E_S
167197:165	Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves , then I think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity \[ f- , \+ \] * to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided *-2 . E_S
167230:60	* To prevent these people from *-1 ever getting out on the street . By , you know , some technicality . E_S
167234:13	and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again *-1 doing the same 0 they did *T*-2 before . E_S
167243:57	Oh , well , I guess , 0 \[ if I , \+ if it \] was someone in my family , I 'd probably feel that way . E_S
167251:18	So if you have someone \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 destroys that value uh , then \[ what \+ \] you want *-2 to take steps * to , uh , minimize the loss . E_S
167287:37	I suppose 0 you could say , well that has something 0 *T*-1 to do with potential for rehabilitation . E_S
167410:28	what *T*-1 happened was that \[ some of \[ the , \+ the \] wa- , \+ a lot of water \] settled on the top E_S
167412:8	and some of the , N_S
167433:38	it was n't , you know , like a commercial project or something . E_S
167434:208	It was sort of just , you know , uh , * \[ gets your , \+ get \[ \[ his , \+ you know , my \] bro- , \+ my brother \] \] and well , maybe , you know , my cousin 's coming over today *-1 to help us do that kind of thing . So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes . E_S
167460:11	They had some property there E_S
167465:27	And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something . E_S
167465:41	And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something . E_S
167498:17	Because the windows are something that *T*-1 is conducive to temperature changes in , uh , you know , the solar game ? E_S
167520:43	and , uh they have put plastic , Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows . E_S
167683:11	He does somewhat . E_S
167687:11	He does somewhat . E_S
167721:33	And \[ when , \+ when \] we see something on sale *T*-1 , uh , instead of * just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up *T*-2 , you know , kind of scrimping * to pay for a medical bill .

167791:27	as far as like big things like something comes up and you have *-1 to buy a T V or a big item , like for the house . E_S
167853:33	Uh , although I I 'm sure 0 to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , E_S
167861:60	\[ And , \+ uh you know , and so \] the students were , you know , to some extent , motivated *-1 to learn . E_S
167894:96	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] mean I just ca n't even picture how that could happen . You know , except maybe to someone who *T*-1 's , you know , really badly learning , uh , disabled or something *T*-2 . E_S

167952:38	\[ \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] heard some , \+ I mean I 've heard \[ \[ sta- , \+ sta- , \] \+ statistics \] \] and things \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 compare a public education to a private education . I mean \[ within \+ like , within \] the same , uh , income groups . E_S
168056:49	\[ \[ Th- , \+ th- , \] \+ there \] was , uh , something *ICH*-2 in the law about 0 if your car was over a certain age , like over twenty years old , you did n't have *-1 to get it done *-3 anymore . E_S

168092:41	They 'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense . E_S
168096:91	And they 're also looking at , uh , other , you know , ways of * monitoring this \[ and , \+ \] cause they 've found out something *ICH*-1 basically that , uh , N_S
168097:23	and a poorly tuned car can emit something , E_S
168183:15	See that 's something 0 in Minneapolis they 're really strict on *T*-1 . E_S
168240:39	If you have yard trash , you put your yard trash in some kind of container . E_S
168331:35	And they just add it on to your water bill or something . E_S
168375:16	But they get into some really good conversations sometimes , you know . E_S

168376:8	And some of it , sometimes it 's serious E_S
168376:19	And some of it , sometimes it 's serious E_S
168377:14	and they have some good feedback and all that stuff E_S
168394:161	Uh , and \[ really , \+ \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ we \] were really \] forced *-2 into *-3 keeping a budget because \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] paid once a month which *T*-1 \[ sort of , \+ sort of \] forces some , uh , uh , restrictions E_S
168432:59	\[ \[ Ac- , \+ ac- , \] \+ actually \] our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we 've moved to California E_S
168450:190	When I , uh , was in , uh , undergraduate school a long , long time ago *T*-1 , I , uh , noted that the \[ monthly salary , \+ starting average monthly \[ salary \+ salary \] \] for engineers \[ that , \+ \] you know , in my discipline , was like oh , six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that . E_S
168620:13	the cost is something E_S
168660:129	On the one hand \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I admire the person who *T*-1 has the guts *-2 to do it because \[ I could n't \+ I could n't \] stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing E_S
168678:18	Like I said , some years ago , I think 0 I would have said 0 there 's no place for capital punishment in the , civilized western country . E_S
168685:53	\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I , \] \+ I \] would n't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around . E_S
168694:29	I 'm beginning *-1 to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and , uh , that , uh , uh , costs and other factors justify , uh , uh , * executing people . E_S
168701:49	and , uh , I 've also never been a victim although \[ I have some , \+ I have two \] friends whose wives *T*-1 were murdered *-2 E_S

168721:49	\[ That ki- , \+ the kids \] maybe on the average get , uh , something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents . E_S
168731:49	Not so much because , uh , it 's bad per se , although there is some pretty crappy programming E_S
168732:33	and \[ I thin- , \+ there 's also some , uh , I think , \] uh , poorer lifestyles illustrated * but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time . E_S
168739:33	\[ I 've , \+ I \] tell myself sometimes , * just sit down after work , E_S
168902:266	I \[ was ju- , \+ started \] *-1 to think about all the big , you know , data bases 0 they have *T*-2 with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those , you know , demographics studies that they do *T*-4 that , *T*-5 um , you know , have , who *T*-6 knows , how much , you know , stuff about all the purchases that you 've made *T*-7 and everything *T*-3 kept tract *-8 somewhere E_S
168933:15	But there were some things *ICH*-3 that people brought *T*-1 up like well what *T*-2 happens if \[ they , \+ they \] get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have *T*-4 . E_S
168948:53	and \[ if they 're , \+ you know , if they 're \] on some kind of , you know , \[ contol- , \+ controlled \] substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who *T*-1 is able *-2 to evaluate them . E_S
168967:83	I mean I 've heard of things like , you know , * \[ making them , \+ you know , marking them \] somehow \[ or , \+ you know , or \] something like that or , you know , putting them all someplace like in a kind of , N_S

169029:49	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 the question is posed *-1 somewhat strangely because , uh , it 's talking about a requirement for public service E_S

169102:41	\[ so . \+ But , \] uh , you know , for some people that 's good . E_S
169134:30	Uh , I know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders . E_S
169138:54	Uh , that *ICH*-1 's kind of gone up in scale \[ and , \+ and \] some other things . E_S
169140:10	Uh , somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck . E_S
169348:15	if you kill someone in your home , as long as they are in your home , it 's considered *-1 self-defense though . E_S
169382:132	Well I think 0 \[ if , \+ if \] you had \[ ha- , \+ \] a handgun though , in other words it was n't premeditated *-1 , you had a handgun , it 's the middle of the night , someone 's down- , N_S
169388:37	Uh , uh \[ I , \+ I \] should say something . E_S
169417:20	and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS . E_S
169418:15	You know , someone will write a book about something E_S
169418:33	You know , someone will write a book about something E_S
169424:7	and somehow , N_S
169441:124	And the view that I would rather take *T*-1 is that there 's a different amount of information 0 you need *T*-2 when you 're particularly interested in a topic or , uh , particularly interested in *-7 buying something \[ as a , \+ you know as a \] hobbyist *T*-5 versus when you want *-3 to go out and buy a blender because you need *-4 to mix things *T*-6 . E_S
169475:51	and \[ I can , \+ I can , \] you know , accept that some people think 0 it 's not *?* and can find better ways 0 * to use it *T*-1 . E_S
169488:34	And I think 0 they 're saying well if something 's really important , I 'll at least find out that it happened . E_S
169494:17	Uh , and if something important happened , it was covered *-1 on T V E_S
169500:7	something that you cared about *T*-1 happened , you 'd find out from friends or other channels . E_S
169520:55	We ended up *-2 watching it for a couple of hours . Zooming out and grabbing something 0 * to eat *T*-1 and then zooming back and \[ ea- , \+ watching \] it some more . E_S
169520:110	We ended up *-2 watching it for a couple of hours . Zooming out and grabbing something 0 * to eat *T*-1 and then zooming back and \[ ea- , \+ watching \] it some more . E_S
169612:32	In fact , they 're going *-1 to execute somebody at the end of this month . E_S
169628:22	You know , it 's someone who *T*-1 had , uh , killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact . E_S
169634:6	something like that , I 've got no problem with it .
169656:9	if somebody gets the death penalty , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] judged *-1 guilty , E_S
169704:36	And , uh , they 've only deliberated four hours or , something E_S
169775:14	and they had some guy that *T*-1 was , uh , defending himself . E_S
169826:13	and it was some Malaria medication E_S
169830:18	because I know of somebody that *T*-1 tested for an airline and did n't get the job E_S
169840:58	Because you should be given *-1 another chance or at least be able *-1 to justify it or something . E_S
169851:42	and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . E_S
169894:40	You know , as a health professional , I would n't want somebody *ICH*-1 to take care of me that *T*-2 was using drugs . E_S
169900:67	So you know , I guess 0 \[ you sort of , \+ you \] have *-1 to have trust some place along the way . E_S
169909:57	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it could be used *-1 *-2 to hassle somebody . E_S
169910:9	If someone was out *-1 to get you , I think that a company or a boss could use this . E_S
169911:47	You know , they could keep on *-1 doing this to you or something , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
169922:35	But maybe you should n't be held *-1 responsible for something 0 you did *T*-2 several years ago . E_S
169930:79	I mean \[ a lot of , \+ a lot of \] people as kids or , you know , young people get into some things that they get out of *T*-1 later on E_S
169968:20	Uh , but , uh , some friends of mine have , uh , gone through this . E_S
169969:80	I think 0 I 'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention *T*-1 and , uh , where they did some things *-2 to try *-3 to keep them , um , mentally alive *T*-4 . And \[ where there was , uh , caring and compassionate , \+ where there were caring and compassionate \] people , uh , operating it *T*-5 . E_S
170002:63	We used *-1 to go \[ once a month , \+ once every two months \] *-2 to visit some of the patients there . E_S
170004:22	and so \[ we , \+ sometimes we 'd \] take him with us . E_S
170010:51	Do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with *T*-1 , that the people who *T*-2 operate it seem *-3 to have , what you 'd perceive of *T*-4 as genuine concern ? E_S
170014:31	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] think sometimes , \+ you know , I 've noticed , \] uh , \[ people asking for , \+ uh , some of the patients asking for \] things *ICH*-1 , uh , just repetitively \[ and , \+ but \] things that *T*-2 are not reasonable , E_S
170014:94	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] think sometimes , \+ you know , I 've noticed , \] uh , \[ people asking for , \+ uh , some of the patients asking for \] things *ICH*-1 , uh , just repetitively \[ and , \+ but \] things that *T*-2 are not reasonable , E_S
170018:13	and so at some level \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] uh , N_S
170027:117	I was thinking also that \[ there 'd be , \+ there could be \] a fair burn out factor um , in * just having *-2 to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going *-3 to be what we would perceive of *T*-1 as rational need *T*-4 . E_S
170051:85	and it did n't look like , uh , you know , how , \[ \[ yo- , \+ you , \] \+ you \] walk into some rooms *T*-1 E_S and \[ there 's , \+ it 's \] completely generic . E_S
170133:26	A couple of times we 've tried some things E_S
170174:68	but when you 're only earning half the salary *T*-1 . Even though I was n't spending much money , \[ I sometimes \+ I sometimes \] would just , N_S

170176:12	Uh , and sometimes what I would do *T*-1 is * keep a piece of paper in my wallet E_S
170201:54	and I figure that , \+ \] so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what *T*-1 's really there . E_S
170214:5	someday , if I were *-1 to get remarried *-2 I might want *-3 to buy a house which *T*-4 requires lots of money which I do n't have *T*-5 E_S
170298:14	We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech . E_S
170298:23	We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech . E_S
170312:54	Uh , while I was sitting here *-1 waiting while they tried *-2 to find somebody 0 for me to talk to *T*-3 , *-1 trying *-8 to think of \[ what , \+ uh , uh , what \] things *ICH*-5 *T*-4 were important , uh , besides salary \[ and a , \+ and a \] job . I guess , uh , MUMBLEx list 0 I had scribbled *T*-6 down was the people 0 you worked with *T*-7 and maybe \[ the , \+ uh , the \] challenge of the work and , uh the working conditions , things like that . E_S
170347:151	And , uh , you know , I think 0 if they had programs that *T*-1 set up *-2 to subsidize people that *T*-3 do get laid *-4 off a little bit better , you know , other than \[ s- , \+ you know , something \] like , N_S
170355:17	So there should be something *ICH*-2 in there or some kind of clause that *T*-1 will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that . E_S

170481:37	And he was treated *-1 like he had five fathers or something . E_S
170605:50	and I do n't think 0 our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some . E_S
170629:57	\[ they , \+ they \] think 0 \[ they , \+ they \] have really done something . E_S
170741:86	But , uh , you know , I hate *-1 to go into \[ a , \+ a \] repair place because they 'll tell me 0 something is wrong with it and it 's not *?* , you know , and *-2 charge me twice as much . E_S
170744:25	And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars E_S
170769:95	And that 's happened to me more than once or twice . \[ \[ Jus- , \+ just , \] \+ just \] about every time 0 I 've went in somewhere *T*-1 . E_S
170848:36	Because I know 0 my grandparents wanted *-1 to have some independence still . E_S
170852:13	They wanted some place 0 they can go and have their meals *T*-1 and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her E_S
170860:12	there was some sort of full-time care place that *T*-1 was also associated *-2 with it E_S
170861:64	so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . But \[ could , \+ could \] also go and eat someplace else . E_S

170894:80	it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S
170903:25	And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed *T*-1 while they still had choices 0 * to make *T*-2 . So they would n't be stuck *-3 going into just whatever nursing home *T*-4 was available at the time . E_S
170938:56	And \[ you probably , \+ if it were you , you probably \] would n't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *T*-1 based on lowest price . E_S
170944:59	And , with medicine being the way 0 it is *T*-1 , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down *T*-2 E_S
170948:55	Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth * continuing *T*-1 . E_S
170952:41	* To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace 0 * to stay *T*-1 E_S
170956:66	and cause like if your spouse died , MUMBLEx all alone , it *EXP*-1 'd be nice * to go someplace with people similar to you . To have friends . E_S
170966:55	Uh , I 've had , uh , three boys *ICH*-1 through , I guess , uh , some child care , each one of them E_S
170974:132	I guess , uh , 0 the only rule , uh , 0 I can think of *T*-1 is that I like *-2 to look for places with , uh , good respectable , nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that . E_S
170979:80	Uh , I think 0 it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want *T*-2 when you buy a car or refrigerator something *T*-1 . E_S
170980:30	You 'd like *-1 to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care . E_S
170998:111	\[ are n't \+ do n't \] \[ they kind of use them for , \+ everybody kind of use them for \] guinea pigs ? \[ For their per- , \+ for their pet theories \] or some such thing ? E_S
171018:35	And I mean you 'd just feel awful if something like that happened . E_S
171030:69	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them *T*-1 E_S
171044:26	and \[ they finding , \+ in some cases they 're finding \] 0 it *EXP*-1 's just not worth it * to work because it 's all going out in daycare . E_S
171175:23	and you had *-1 to do something , E_S
171232:7	some of that is really bad I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
171309:31	Well I think 0 the court systems could stand some improvement . E_S
171311:140	but \[ a lot of time i- , \+ a lot of cases , \] uh , * is circumstantial evidence \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 convicts a person , which I do n't think 0 *T*-2 is all the time good . Because sometimes it *EXP*-3 's hard * to get all the facts and to \[ prove a person innocent , \+ I mean prove a person guilty \] if you do n't really know or you do n't really have an eyewitness . E_S
171312:20	And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence *T*-1 is beyond me . E_S
171362:22	Well , \[ s- , \+ sometimes \] the sentencing \[ is still , \+ is not \] fair . E_S
171374:67	Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom , I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone 's guilty or innocent . E_S
171392:65	but \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I like the system that they have *T*-1 in some places where the defendant \[ gets *-3 to choose whether he 's , \+ goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *T*-2 to choose \] it *T*-4 . E_S
171393:18	\[ Some , \+ some \] cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . E_S
171393:29	\[ Some , \+ some \] cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . E_S
171406:112	But , the thing is too , 0 maybe they need \[ more of a , \+ I do n't know , more of a \] expert types \[ to , \+ to \] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever \[ an- , \+ and \] call them in . E_S
171429:103	and , uh , there would be more honest settlements instead of this , uh , tugging of people 's heart strings and , uh * making them cry and feel like they 're doing somebody good by *-2 \[ giving them \+ or giving them \] two million dollars 0 *T*-1 to make up for the pain and suffering . E_S
171448:70	But I think 0 \[ about , \+ uh , about \] a year ago , uh , I bought a product from some company down \[ at , \+ uh , in \] Atlanta , Georgia . E_S
171454:40	but I found that , uh , it was made *-1 of some material which *T*-2 actually ended up *-3 rusting uh , after , N_S
171462:5	something was very , very wrong with the blade . E_S
171538:26	Well at least you 're talking to somebody who *T*-1 counts . E_S
171549:36	but I just felt like , well at least I did something . E_S
171567:40	I 've heard stories where you can literally \] buy something from them one year , wear it for a year and a half , E_S and even after , like eighteen months of , you know , reasonably satisfactory use , they will accept it in any condition *T*-1 E_S
171568:49	and they will gladly , no questions asked *-1 , take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide 0 you do n't want it anymore . E_S
171580:103	uh , I guess 0 \[ Bean 's , \+ one of Bean 's \] big competitors is Land 's End out in , uh , I guess 0 it 's *RNR*-1 Wisconsin somewhere . E_S
171608:53	Uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , way back , what , twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer *T*-3 , I did what everybody else does *T*-4 , which *T*-1 is * to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks , and , you know , checkbooks and all this kind of thing E_S
171696:140	But \[ we 're shopping around as far as , \+ well I 'm shopping around as far as \] *-2 trying \[ * to get , \+ uh , that 's why I 'm doing this *T*-1 , *-4 to get \] some extra money . And , uh , getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts . E_S
171715:66	Actually , it was a subsidiary \[ of a , \+ of an \] outfit called * U S Shoe or something . E_S
171735:13	uh , MUMBLEx somebody was knocking on my door here . E_S
171787:14	They 've had some serious problems in the past couple of years . E_S
171800:122	and he always had \[ this , \+ uh , this \] wonderful quality of \[ c- , \+ \] * being able *-1 to put his foot in his mouth every time 0 he went * to say something *T*-2 E_S
171801:25	and , uh , they 've had some financial problems with the team and so forth . E_S
171802:32	And it recently was sold *-1 to , uh , some other people E_S
171877:28	and that 's suppose *-1 to be some of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] male bonding \[ and the , \+ and the , \] uh , the male instincts , I guess 0 *T*-2 , or something about the , uh , N_S

172075:110	Uh , so that , uh , a judge , I think 0 *T*-3 , would be the most appropriate person 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] be able *-2 to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . E_S
172078:56	\[ I , \+ I \] kind of agree with that , because I think 0 in some cases , uh , the jury may not even have , the information about other crimes 0 the person has committed *T*-1 . E_S
172086:38	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think that in some cases that 's considered *-1 to prejudice the current case E_S
172116:15	there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed *-1 a jury trial *T*-2 ? E_S
172153:17	But I meant for some , when both parties agreed that yes , we 're going *-1 to have a judge here *T*-2 . E_S
172179:206	But I think 0 most lawyers do a pretty good job of * making that evident \[ to , \+ to \] clients unless they feel 0 they can , you know , tweak a jury into \[ per- , \+ \] *-1 giving a different sentence or possibly , if it 's a civil case , giving higher , uh , you know , awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of \[ the , \+ the \] award . E_S
172313:40	I 've found that most of homework assignments MUMBLEx really require some sort of computer , uh , simulation or analysis , E_S

172699:42	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's really something that \[ the , \+ uh , the \] government ought *-6 to encourage *T*-1 more because , uh , there are all these complaints about how we 're not a saving country *T*-2 and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in , uh , Germany and Japan *T*-5 .

175818:89	Well , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 we did , \+ I think 0 we did \] learn some lessons that \[ we were n't , \+ uh , we were n't \] prepared for *T*-1 , E_S
175992:40	\[ I wish , \+ I wish \] 0 we had something . E_S
175996:27	I think 0 it was , 0 somebody was \[ \[ just scarcely \+ just , \] \+ just \] ripping the hell out of \[ someo- , \+ another person . \] E_S
175996:85	I think 0 it was , 0 somebody was \[ \[ just scarcely \+ just , \] \+ just \] ripping the hell out of \[ someo- , \+ another person . \] E_S
176065:28	If I absolutely had *-1 to have something , I could go *-2 use it . E_S
176096:25	And my intent was that whenever something *ICH*-4 went on sale that I really had *-3 to have *T*-2 *T*-1 , I would have the cash * to buy it right then and there . And not ever have *-5 to spend any money on interest . E_S
176105:37	and you know , \[ if , \+ if \] something goes on sale and I do n't have the money , I still do n't buy it . E_S
176176:82	But you 're lucky *-1 to have her because if you 're like me and you have difficulty *-2 spending money , you need somebody 0 *T*-3 to help you spend it . E_S
176208:133	and \[ \[ w- , \+ why , \] \+ why \] would they be interested \[ in , \+ in \] your little turnip unless , you know , one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well 0 that 's somebody 0 * to molest *T*-1 , you know *T*-2 . E_S
176232:13	and that is sometimes what some women who *T*-1 have *-2 to work ,
176232:22	and that is sometimes what some women who *T*-1 have *-2 to work ,
176252:56	Well you must have \[ a , \+ \] just one hero ace professional job * to support something like that . E_S
176264:42	\[ So , \+ uh , but \] I think 0 there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children E_S
176316:22	I mean they really had some great opportunities . E_S
176325:5	sometimes they do put them in , uh , fairly low paying \[ sit- , \+ situations . \] E_S
176331:5	somebody will have a job at three hundred a week * to get off welfare E_S
176364:49	Well , you know , but you made the comment *ICH*-1 earlier , why would someone be interested in children *T*-2 . E_S
176366:29	\[ th- , \+ there \] have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences . E_S
176487:27	I 'm sure 0 there must be some good ones around here somewhere . E_S
176487:40	I 'm sure 0 there must be some good ones around here somewhere . E_S
176571:17	and they said 0 somebody 's got *-1 to pick him up . E_S
176599:17	and I 've got some very definite , uh , opinions about it *ICH*-1 . Uh , you know , which *T*-2 have n't changed all that much from my first reactions \[ from , \+ from \] \[ when they , \+ when they \] announced it *T*-3 . But , uh , developed a little more , I guess , but have n't changed that much . E_S
176612:69	My feeling is that certain jobs that when there 's immediate threat to life and limb , uh , if should somebody be under the influence of drugs *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I 'd \] be willing *-2 to support that . E_S
176621:17	he crashed and killed some people because he was , uh , smoking some marijuana E_S
176621:42	he crashed and killed some people because he was , uh , smoking some marijuana E_S
176639:60	Uh , and so \[ it 's , \+ it 's required for certain , \] \+ \[ some form , \+ some form \] of drug program is required \] * to get the government contracts E_S
176639:71	Uh , and so \[ it 's , \+ it 's required for certain , \] \+ \[ some form , \+ some form \] of drug program is required \] * to get the government contracts E_S
176649:101	first off \[ we do n't , \+ we do n't \] have enough courage * to , uh , pick out the people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 have some sort of indication of possible drug usage , uh , because that would offend them , uh , \[ if they , \+ if they \] were n't *?* . E_S
176676:79	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] \[ th- , \+ there \] needs *-1 to be a line drawn * somewhere \[ at , \+ \] \[ rea- , \+ reasonable \] and proper . E_S
176693:117	And \[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ essentially \] the first thing \[ is t- , \+ is on the \] order of MUMBLEx paper in the urine \[ and , \+ uh , or \] some , you know , N_S
176724:59	And \[ I , \+ uh , at that time I \] could justify it in terms of someone new *ICH*-1 coming in , 0 \[ you do n't , \+ you do n't \] know *T*-2 . E_S
176725:27	But , on the other hand , uh , someone new coming in that *T*-2 knows 0 they 're going *-3 to have a test , N_S
176780:40	So , we \[ left it , \+ left it \] to somebody who *T*-1 does it for a living . E_S
176826:15	It 's just somewhere 0 * to drive another car *T*-3 *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] park E_S
176837:34	It 's on about uh , twenty-two inch piers , something like that . E_S
176867:12	I helped somebody do one of those before . E_S
176895:36	Especially when you get done *T*-1 , you 've got something , you know . E_S
176903:54	\[ I \+ I \] built it *-1 two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and , uh , a backrest and all that stuff . E_S
176926:44	\[ A , \+ a \] contractor friend helped me , uh , with some of the , uh , foundation work E_S
177018:15	You 've got something going all the time . E_S
177054:105	Rodney got beat *-1 up because \[ \[ \[ he , \+ he , \] \+ you know , he pur- , \] \+ you know , he involved \] himself in some \[ sub , \+ self-destructive \] behavior . E_S
177069:19	you know , \[ some , \+ some \] black guy with capital is going *-1 to come in and invest in that area ? E_S
177069:28	you know , \[ some , \+ some \] black guy with capital is going *-1 to come in and invest in that area ? E_S
177116:38	Or just \[ a by- , \+ an innocent bystander \] or somebody got actually beat *-1 to death or what . E_S
177185:24	And you say 0 you have some strong feelings about , uh , the issue ? E_S
177229:44	they always want *-1 to be able *-2 to , uh , do some brain draining . E_S
177236:32	and so they can almost always find room for someone like that . E_S
177237:94	At the bottom end , they , uh , are always willing *-1 to , uh , let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of * doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the , powerful people in that area . E_S
177290:115	So \[ there 's , \+ uh , there 's \] a lot 0 *T*-1 to be said *-4 for * having a steady stream of people who *T*-2 know how it is *T*-3 someplace else coming in . E_S
177292:14	But there 's some differences in the immigrants , \[ that , \+ that \] we 're getting *T*-1 now . E_S
177363:11	but if somebody can make a regulation about it , they will *?* . E_S
177383:45	And the thing that *T*-1 just was in the local news bulletin was , somebody \[ \[ has , \+ uh , ter- , \] \+ made \] some special , uh , polymers that *T*-2 have the ability * to , uh , make certain actinide elements adhere to them . E_S

177386:59	Uh , uh , they 've , uh , looked at , uh , plutonium and uranium and , uh , some other similar things *-2 to try *-1 to remove those from radio active waste E_S
177442:25	and , uh , unless you do something like that , \[ y- , \+ you 're \] going *-1 to get sick . E_S
177485:35	\[ I 'm not , \+ it 's not \] something 0 I really enjoy *T*-1 all that much that , \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] probably , N_S

177571:11	It 's something , E_S
177607:14	I 've done some other things too . Uh , you know . E_S
177631:33	Maple top I think \[ or \+ or \] something of that sort . E_S
177754:16	Especially , I did some cabinets in , uh , ash and oak E_S
177775:14	I 've cut some one by eight oak before . E_S
